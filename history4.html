    <h2 data-content-id="U8D6BQZotIxg1IgGVeQTDzORZXBApldezGducnG4ou5SdxZRN_eCT_HJWZRQgbaA6" class="head1">THE PRACTICE IN THE UNITED STATES</h2><p data-content-id="MChS44jzGMa4wRjXH-mu8h2LZNeoVxO4pq0LdHaEgUl-MC8IGPvPO0OZfb-lHo1zt"> After arriving in the United States, I spoke a little on the Lord’s table and the significance of the breaking of bread. I said that we should remember the Lord first and then worship the Father, but in all these, there was no regulation. The significance of breaking the bread is to remember the Lord, but this does not mean that repeatedly singing “When we survey the wondrous cross” is the only way to remember the Lord. Certainly, such hymns for the remembrance of the Lord are right, but we cannot be regulated by ordinances. A hymn such as “Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!” which not only enlivens the spirit but also has a sweet taste, is truly a hymn for remembering the Lord as well. </p>
    <p data-content-id="V7aDZxBlTqThMzqEGUHc_rEE6higcErVaUPL_odu_4ddX0SS-KSIBH78AGF5Kxj3Q"> The prayer meeting also should not be regulated. In Taiwan a responsible brother would suggest a hymn at the beginning, and after singing it, another responsible brother would stand up and announce <span id="389" data-page-id="389" class="pg">[389]</span> the items for prayer. Then a few brothers and sisters would pray long prayers, and at the end someone might even give a message. This is not incorrect, but the exercise of the spirit was not so strong. Leading a meeting in the past was very difficult and also a suffering. </p>
    <p data-content-id="ien0waqxaF4oFwsBQquNZnNNHeKmGjhQXVoGXCNBtqK7RrH8Rl6GZS6YY6ZqgP0IJ"> In America, when a prayer meeting starts, there is not an announcement of prayer items, nor is there the giving of a message at the end. There is often even no singing of hymns. At a quarter past seven, before seven thirty, two brothers will start to pray. When another brother comes in, he joins the prayer, and when another one enters, he also joins the prayer. They pray in this way for an hour and a half, and there is much exercise of the spirit and much supply. These are all improvements in practice based on our experience and seeing. </p>
    <p data-content-id="14CNNJ9eRuzbAFhrK1-JnJOo_FZxhrDlm2JwlF4osRa1uJlcwZeN86DPwyj8b8Puf"> In the spring of 1958 I was prepared to go abroad to visit Europe and America. The brothers came and said to me, “Brother Lee, we truly feel that we need some supply. We seem to be too dead.” Thus, we had a conference on “Eating, Drinking, and Enjoying the Lord.” After one of the meetings, a young professor at Taiwan University came to me and said, “Brother Lee, the message today was very good, but the phrase <em>eating the Lord</em> is somewhat wild.” He was always very receptive to my messages, so I said, “Brother, I may be wild, but the Lord Jesus took the lead to be wild. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="288269" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span> He said, ‘He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.’” In that conference the more I spoke, the more enjoyable it was. Therefore, I had another conference on “How to Enjoy God” and still another conference on “How to Eat and Drink the Lord by Reading the Word.” There were three consecutive conferences, almost one week after another. I was very much supplied. </p>
    <p data-content-id="9636w8hfrN2orMkPf2S0syNfDF67twPmhFwZcGFdEWn98nHoFAvQDiJtjeey8JPgH"> After returning from England, I spoke on the building of the church, but I discovered that everyone’s spirit was not living. How can there be the building up of the church if the spirit does not rise up? Therefore, by 1961 I began to speak on the matters of exercising the spirit, releasing the spirit, and being mingled in spirit. I even wrote new hymns, such as “Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!” and “O glorious Christ, Savior mine, / Thou art truly radiance divine” (<em>Hymns,</em> #499, #501). These hymns caused people to become more living, but I eventually discovered that the co-workers sang them to the point that they did not like to sing them as much. The more I spoke on exercising the spirit, the less spirit there seemed to be. At the end of that year I went to America. <span id="390" data-page-id="390" class="pg">[390]</span> </p>
    <p data-content-id="jLf_-2fX6UmbfbE4Q4AcpCOUp5u-jgfC7QxT2_QPbkvlxwGgjseqIZ3dCxJGm3JqC"> From the beginning, the work in the United States began with the spirit; nevertheless, this beginning was not initiated by me. The testimony in the United States began entirely through prayer. As soon as I stood up to speak, the Spirit was living. There was a difference between the recovery in the United States and in Taiwan. In Taiwan the stress was on doctrines with many regulations, whereas in the United States the emphasis was on the spirit. Now, however, the meetings in Taiwan have improved very much and have substantially come out of regulations. </p>
    <p data-content-id="TZPjD3eaAEvknfaoPr30YtfQ2DvSS09fMu2kgW8C8OhkgG_vdQbjm-9xclyF_2L1h"> In the past the custom of the Chinese brothers and sisters was to either not give a testimony or give a long testimony. Often they would begin by speaking about their forefathers from three generations ago. After speaking for twenty-five minutes, they still might not be at the main subject. Their original intention was to supply life to the people, but instead, they caused others to be deflated. It was entirely different in the United States. No one taught the saints there how to give a testimony, but they began with the spirit. As soon as they stood up, they would release their spirit, saying, “Thank and praise the Lord! I am a sinner. One day I prayed, ‘O Lord,’ I became living from within, and I was saved.” No testimony would go over one minute. Later, some responsible brothers even set a rule that a person’s testimony should not exceed twenty seconds so that three people could give testimonies in one minute. Nevertheless, this should not become a regulation. Speaking in a meeting is like performing a musical piece; sometimes the tempo is faster, and sometimes it is a little slower. Sometimes the music should be a little louder, and sometimes it should be softer. In any case, it must be living and according to the spirit. </p>
    <p data-content-id="ncOAZQUsBQTDzVA6wlRcAXIHyvpiFEW4Qt-PcuKAWs7ILlVOhM8zDw54YNMNzHMNN"> I also released some basic truths in the United States. I gave messages concerning Christ, such as Christ being life and Christ being the Spirit, and concerning the church, such as the content of the church, the reality of the church, and the ground of the church. All these messages have been printed into books. For ordinary American Christians these truths were unknown. Almost everyone was surprised because no one had ever told them that there was a spirit within man. Those who are recently saved among us here know that there is a spirit within man. However, in America the truth that there is a spirit in man was new, yet many people accepted it. Those who had other intentions eventually left. <span id="391" data-page-id="391" class="pg">[391]</span> </p>
    <p data-content-id="6pOSsROSZcsSLSaM_do4O0YZyzpzvu4ztMs8IVbchVgzmuD4PjZDMw_O4npH3AKVU"> The testimony of the Lord’s recovery in America was not smooth; every year there was some turbulence, and the principles were the same as those we saw in mainland China. On the one hand, many were truly hungry and thirsty, and they were truly seeking because formal and organized Christianity could not satisfy their inner needs. Thus, many small groups were raised up. On the other hand, in any group of people, there are those who like to take the lead, even among the so-called seeking Christians. Some people truly have the zeal and desire to testify for the Lord, to help others understand the Bible, and to teach people spiritual matters, but they must be the leaders; otherwise, they will not be satisfied and will leave. There were some such situations of mixture. </p>
    <p data-content-id="RZlPxLfziMHc9UDCBnLtc7PnE6QbLw0vBcRXGaTy5sEkEDmz5zs9o6JVED5YHHUof"> In 1962 the testimony of the church officially started in Los Angeles. At the end of the year I went to Los Angeles to start the work. On the first day of 1963 I was invited to a home to give a conference, and afterward I went out to visit other places. I visited many places and met many kinds of people. At that time there were four groups of seeking believers near Los Angeles. One group had a Brethren teaching background, another group had a Pentecostal background, another small group had an uncertain background, and then there was us. During the conference, people from these other groups came, and their responsible ones were willing to continue to fellowship with us. </p>
    <p data-content-id="s0IM7um95aIDSEQmkz8SiZ6iB7UzFFOw2MHw1MC2Fge-V4ym_8ndik756xygk_O9v"> After fellowshipping for over two months, they proposed that we join together and have the church life. Thus, the four groups decided to meet together every Lord’s Day morning and to meet separately at their own places in the afternoon or evening. This joint meeting was held for over a year, and all the people would come together to pray and sing hymns. Some also stood up to speak. When the four groups came together, the number was quite large. In the beginning quite a number of people would speak, especially those who were somewhat taking the lead. They stood up one after another like the popping of popcorn. However, as the weeks passed, there was less popping, and eventually, not many people stood up. In the end only I was left to speak; after some time the responsible ones of the three groups were unwilling to continue the joint meeting. Since this was the case, we asked everyone to return to their respective places to meet on their own. </p>
    <p data-content-id="wyEUpIjwSXJsd3rz3tPe0UI6RY79uCduVqUUV_xXoEBAeVqt_73dH_FG3FxIS5325"> This shows that the work of the Lord’s recovery in America was <span id="392" data-page-id="392" class="pg">[392]</span> not easy and smooth. The discontinuation of the joint meeting, however, should not be considered to be a problem or a loss, because the leaders of the other three groups did not see the light and did not have the heart to take this way. They only desired a little spiritual activity—to preach the gospel zealously, to teach people to read the Bible, and then to become leaders themselves. Even though this was a loss, we experienced a bigger loss from those who worked together with us in this testimony but who had opinions. </p>
