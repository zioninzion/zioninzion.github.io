    <h2 data-content-id="U8D6BQZotIxg1IgGVeQTDzORZXBApldezGducnG4ou5SdxZRN_eCT_HJWZRQgbaA6" class="head1">THE PRACTICE IN THE UNITED STATES</h2><p data-content-id="MChS44jzGMa4wRjXH-mu8h2LZNeoVxO4pq0LdHaEgUl-MC8IGPvPO0OZfb-lHo1zt"> After arriving in the United States, I spoke a little on the Lord’s table and the significance of the breaking of bread. I said that we should remember the Lord first and then worship the Father, but in all these, there was no regulation. The significance of breaking the bread is to remember the Lord, but this does not mean that repeatedly singing “When we survey the wondrous cross” is the only way to remember the Lord. Certainly, such hymns for the remembrance of the Lord are right, but we cannot be regulated by ordinances. A hymn such as “Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!” which not only enlivens the spirit but also has a sweet taste, is truly a hymn for remembering the Lord as well. </p>
    <p data-content-id="V7aDZxBlTqThMzqEGUHc_rEE6higcErVaUPL_odu_4ddX0SS-KSIBH78AGF5Kxj3Q"> The prayer meeting also should not be regulated. In Taiwan a responsible brother would suggest a hymn at the beginning, and after singing it, another responsible brother would stand up and announce <span id="389" data-page-id="389" class="pg">[389]</span> the items for prayer. Then a few brothers and sisters would pray long prayers, and at the end someone might even give a message. This is not incorrect, but the exercise of the spirit was not so strong. Leading a meeting in the past was very difficult and also a suffering. </p>
    <p data-content-id="ien0waqxaF4oFwsBQquNZnNNHeKmGjhQXVoGXCNBtqK7RrH8Rl6GZS6YY6ZqgP0IJ"> In America, when a prayer meeting starts, there is not an announcement of prayer items, nor is there the giving of a message at the end. There is often even no singing of hymns. At a quarter past seven, before seven thirty, two brothers will start to pray. When another brother comes in, he joins the prayer, and when another one enters, he also joins the prayer. They pray in this way for an hour and a half, and there is much exercise of the spirit and much supply. These are all improvements in practice based on our experience and seeing. </p>
    <p data-content-id="14CNNJ9eRuzbAFhrK1-JnJOo_FZxhrDlm2JwlF4osRa1uJlcwZeN86DPwyj8b8Puf"> In the spring of 1958 I was prepared to go abroad to visit Europe and America. The brothers came and said to me, “Brother Lee, we truly feel that we need some supply. We seem to be too dead.” Thus, we had a conference on “Eating, Drinking, and Enjoying the Lord.” After one of the meetings, a young professor at Taiwan University came to me and said, “Brother Lee, the message today was very good, but the phrase <em>eating the Lord</em> is somewhat wild.” He was always very receptive to my messages, so I said, “Brother, I may be wild, but the Lord Jesus took the lead to be wild. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="288269" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span> He said, ‘He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.’” In that conference the more I spoke, the more enjoyable it was. Therefore, I had another conference on “How to Enjoy God” and still another conference on “How to Eat and Drink the Lord by Reading the Word.” There were three consecutive conferences, almost one week after another. I was very much supplied. </p>
    <p data-content-id="9636w8hfrN2orMkPf2S0syNfDF67twPmhFwZcGFdEWn98nHoFAvQDiJtjeey8JPgH"> After returning from England, I spoke on the building of the church, but I discovered that everyone’s spirit was not living. How can there be the building up of the church if the spirit does not rise up? Therefore, by 1961 I began to speak on the matters of exercising the spirit, releasing the spirit, and being mingled in spirit. I even wrote new hymns, such as “Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!” and “O glorious Christ, Savior mine, / Thou art truly radiance divine” (<em>Hymns,</em> #499, #501). These hymns caused people to become more living, but I eventually discovered that the co-workers sang them to the point that they did not like to sing them as much. The more I spoke on exercising the spirit, the less spirit there seemed to be. At the end of that year I went to America. <span id="390" data-page-id="390" class="pg">[390]</span> </p>
    <p data-content-id="jLf_-2fX6UmbfbE4Q4AcpCOUp5u-jgfC7QxT2_QPbkvlxwGgjseqIZ3dCxJGm3JqC"> From the beginning, the work in the United States began with the spirit; nevertheless, this beginning was not initiated by me. The testimony in the United States began entirely through prayer. As soon as I stood up to speak, the Spirit was living. There was a difference between the recovery in the United States and in Taiwan. In Taiwan the stress was on doctrines with many regulations, whereas in the United States the emphasis was on the spirit. Now, however, the meetings in Taiwan have improved very much and have substantially come out of regulations. </p>
    <p data-content-id="TZPjD3eaAEvknfaoPr30YtfQ2DvSS09fMu2kgW8C8OhkgG_vdQbjm-9xclyF_2L1h"> In the past the custom of the Chinese brothers and sisters was to either not give a testimony or give a long testimony. Often they would begin by speaking about their forefathers from three generations ago. After speaking for twenty-five minutes, they still might not be at the main subject. Their original intention was to supply life to the people, but instead, they caused others to be deflated. It was entirely different in the United States. No one taught the saints there how to give a testimony, but they began with the spirit. As soon as they stood up, they would release their spirit, saying, “Thank and praise the Lord! I am a sinner. One day I prayed, ‘O Lord,’ I became living from within, and I was saved.” No testimony would go over one minute. Later, some responsible brothers even set a rule that a person’s testimony should not exceed twenty seconds so that three people could give testimonies in one minute. Nevertheless, this should not become a regulation. Speaking in a meeting is like performing a musical piece; sometimes the tempo is faster, and sometimes it is a little slower. Sometimes the music should be a little louder, and sometimes it should be softer. In any case, it must be living and according to the spirit. </p>
    <p data-content-id="ncOAZQUsBQTDzVA6wlRcAXIHyvpiFEW4Qt-PcuKAWs7ILlVOhM8zDw54YNMNzHMNN"> I also released some basic truths in the United States. I gave messages concerning Christ, such as Christ being life and Christ being the Spirit, and concerning the church, such as the content of the church, the reality of the church, and the ground of the church. All these messages have been printed into books. For ordinary American Christians these truths were unknown. Almost everyone was surprised because no one had ever told them that there was a spirit within man. Those who are recently saved among us here know that there is a spirit within man. However, in America the truth that there is a spirit in man was new, yet many people accepted it. Those who had other intentions eventually left. <span id="391" data-page-id="391" class="pg">[391]</span> </p>
    <p data-content-id="6pOSsROSZcsSLSaM_do4O0YZyzpzvu4ztMs8IVbchVgzmuD4PjZDMw_O4npH3AKVU"> The testimony of the Lord’s recovery in America was not smooth; every year there was some turbulence, and the principles were the same as those we saw in mainland China. On the one hand, many were truly hungry and thirsty, and they were truly seeking because formal and organized Christianity could not satisfy their inner needs. Thus, many small groups were raised up. On the other hand, in any group of people, there are those who like to take the lead, even among the so-called seeking Christians. Some people truly have the zeal and desire to testify for the Lord, to help others understand the Bible, and to teach people spiritual matters, but they must be the leaders; otherwise, they will not be satisfied and will leave. There were some such situations of mixture. </p>
    <p data-content-id="RZlPxLfziMHc9UDCBnLtc7PnE6QbLw0vBcRXGaTy5sEkEDmz5zs9o6JVED5YHHUof"> In 1962 the testimony of the church officially started in Los Angeles. At the end of the year I went to Los Angeles to start the work. On the first day of 1963 I was invited to a home to give a conference, and afterward I went out to visit other places. I visited many places and met many kinds of people. At that time there were four groups of seeking believers near Los Angeles. One group had a Brethren teaching background, another group had a Pentecostal background, another small group had an uncertain background, and then there was us. During the conference, people from these other groups came, and their responsible ones were willing to continue to fellowship with us. </p>
    <p data-content-id="s0IM7um95aIDSEQmkz8SiZ6iB7UzFFOw2MHw1MC2Fge-V4ym_8ndik756xygk_O9v"> After fellowshipping for over two months, they proposed that we join together and have the church life. Thus, the four groups decided to meet together every Lord’s Day morning and to meet separately at their own places in the afternoon or evening. This joint meeting was held for over a year, and all the people would come together to pray and sing hymns. Some also stood up to speak. When the four groups came together, the number was quite large. In the beginning quite a number of people would speak, especially those who were somewhat taking the lead. They stood up one after another like the popping of popcorn. However, as the weeks passed, there was less popping, and eventually, not many people stood up. In the end only I was left to speak; after some time the responsible ones of the three groups were unwilling to continue the joint meeting. Since this was the case, we asked everyone to return to their respective places to meet on their own. </p>
    <p data-content-id="wyEUpIjwSXJsd3rz3tPe0UI6RY79uCduVqUUV_xXoEBAeVqt_73dH_FG3FxIS5325"> This shows that the work of the Lord’s recovery in America was <span id="392" data-page-id="392" class="pg">[392]</span> not easy and smooth. The discontinuation of the joint meeting, however, should not be considered to be a problem or a loss, because the leaders of the other three groups did not see the light and did not have the heart to take this way. They only desired a little spiritual activity—to preach the gospel zealously, to teach people to read the Bible, and then to become leaders themselves. Even though this was a loss, we experienced a bigger loss from those who worked together with us in this testimony but who had opinions. </p>

    <h2 data-content-id="JPqITnrszRhXX3IIJMNg6At_DXeB3uqKpWwef3OUbsNXlXqA280Fdvm2rPkLCiMmP" class="head1">THE SOURCE OF OPPOSITION IN THE UNITED STATES</h2><p data-content-id="zNNllKtFRXbZ5F6IH3GU566aOBCqtGSQinhQeBUvezf_CdWw--munuNeXFh39wPUi"> The United States is the largest Christian nation in the world, with more than one hundred million Christians. No other country has as many Christians, who make up half of the American population. Forty million of these people are in the Roman Catholic Church, while the rest are mainly in Protestant denominations. About thirty to forty percent of these people are saved, which is at least thirty million people. Many are zealous and pursue the truth. In the last decade or so, a large number of people have joined the so-called Neo-Pentecostal movement. In this kind of environment one can imagine the great battle that the Lord’s recovery has had to fight. </p>
    <p data-content-id="a3vCx4i8WlLz_PiJSBR2S_cFxCd6i6ntmH_KEkH1ZRlzbdoWBUM8TWOQgDKj_BKED"> Although the entire Roman Catholic Church and the majority of the Protestant denominations oppose the Lord’s recovery, the Roman Catholic Church and the four relatively major orthodox Protestant denominations—the Southern Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Episcopal Church, and the Methodist Church—have not paid too much attention to us. In 1963 and 1964, however, the Southern Baptists paid some attention to us because almost all those gained by the Lord’s recovery in America were Southern Baptists. Although there were not too many, they were the younger generation of pastors and leaders in the Southern Baptist Church, and they were also students or graduates of universities operated by the Southern Baptist Convention. Hence, the Southern Baptists were quite concerned at one point. A theology professor among them even spent time studying us and then wrote an article called “Oriental Mysticism,” which said that we were an Oriental inner-life sect. The article said that my speaking had the flavor of Chinese philosophy and ethics. Although the article was written in a polite tone, it was an example of a blind man feeling an elephant and speaking without knowing anything about us. <span id="468" data-page-id="468" class="pg">[468]</span> </p>
    <p data-content-id="bcZGtdWhgZOZ-Y1BV89MTJBP64rBWnBHKHFLQPHWY_43N0UQB8fEviuvPqU6tFQnj"> The group that opposed us the most was a gospel work known as Campus Crusade for Christ. In the 1960s almost fifty of the most outstanding workers among them suddenly resigned and left because they were dissatisfied with the work. This was a great setback in the gospel work on college campuses. When this happened, the Lord’s recovery had been in America for five to six years. In 1968 more than one hundred thirty saints from America visited Taiwan and the churches in the Far East. They also attended an international conference in Taipei. After they returned, the Lord’s recovery in America entered a peak period. When these outstanding leading co-workers in the gospel work on college campuses were leaving en masse in 1969, the Lord’s recovery was reaching its peak. These people were attracted to the Lord’s recovery, and the Lord’s recovery became the focus of their attention. </p>
    <p data-content-id="qQaAD7XiouqLp6NcUfBf7e60DQ4l4WImBTrXfwMT9O8IioN4X6bI_LkdK0AUUOLcA"> At that time there was a brother among us who had been a traveling preacher for the Southern Baptist Church. He was quite familiar with the people involved in the gospel work on college campuses, and he came in contact with the people who had left the gospel work on college campuses. A few of them came to listen to our messages, and one of them came to hall one in Los Angeles to listen to our messages for a long time. Some of them considered whether they should turn to be among us. </p>
    <p data-content-id="yvk6HuMr8NgKovSLAlIbjjPVD6W8ccI-fVU1RmyX_JmUCh44kI4RinDco5-pK15fw"> They knew that they could not go back to the denominations, because the 1960s were a transition period between an old and new generation in America. An atmosphere of new thinking permeated everything, and even the young generation in Christianity, who had a heart for the Lord, did not want old things. They saw the Lord’s recovery as truly being something completely new. Moreover, the truth in the Lord’s recovery was very clear, rich, and deep. If anyone can speak about the truth and the Bible, he will surely be popular in America. Hence, they wanted to turn to the Lord’s recovery. They were hoping that I would ordain them to be apostles. After some investigation they discovered that we had no practice of ordaining apostles. Thus, they felt that our way would not work; instead, they established a new sect because they wanted a future for themselves. </p>
    <p data-content-id="8586EAxGNMxjCFvPw26Y0F6x_VLL_L8dGb1RINqEGoPxy9ueANCkxDrrJB8Kb6J6e"> They studied the situation of Christianity in the United States as well as church history. They felt that the United States needed a new type of Christianity, but they had nothing new to speak. Then they discovered that the Eastern Orthodox Church was more ancient and <span id="469" data-page-id="469" class="pg">[469]</span> orthodox than the Roman Catholic Church. They felt that the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations had all deviated from orthodoxy and that only the Eastern Orthodox Church remained orthodox. For example, the Eastern Orthodox Church had been a powerful influence long before the papal system in the Roman Catholic Church was acknowledged at the end of the sixth century. </p>
    <p data-content-id="D9KUdi_no0eRPkcjlvhx9JmYce7_tnIt4aqXfXwv8FY1ZUChvg2Krd4iCqUQot_i2"> Therefore, a group of people who left the gospel work on college campuses decided to transplant everything in the Eastern Orthodox Church to the United States. They said that their emphasis was not on following the Bible but rather on following the councils that had convened to determine doctrine in the first few centuries. The first of these councils was the Council of Nicaea. They wanted to observe the resolutions instituted by the councils in the period prior to the full establishment of the Roman Catholic Church in the sixth century. This was a call to Protestants in America to return to tradition. They set up an organization called the Evangelical Orthodox Church (EOC) and ordained themselves as bishops. Every one of the founders became a bishop. </p>
    <p data-content-id="SWyxoso-wsZbMNWh1AYeh7ocRgzftzgzkfAWjmC6gH4byXV0VFFVRr-Mzb4DNsvi6"> After the establishment of the EOC, they began to study how to promote the Eastern Orthodox Church in America. At that time all the denominations in America had become old, although there were some diverse and even strange and peculiar new religions being raised up. Since the people in the EOC had been involved in gospel work, they knew that these diverse things would not last because there was no truth in them. However, there were solid things in the Lord’s recovery that would not only last but also be full of impact, like a newly raised army. Thus, they knew that in order to open the door to orthodoxy in America, they had to knock down the Lord’s recovery; and in order to knock down the Lord’s recovery, they had to defeat Watchman Nee and Witness Lee. </p>
    <p data-content-id="gMRP6oLRCKOOeXy92nE8xWUQ6FHGCR2TBckzIb4y6VE5ENpvOJytKzoRfjKtTAGf6"> They did some further study and found that Watchman Nee’s books were very popular in America and had a far-reaching impact. Thus, it would be difficult to knock him down. Therefore, they decided to first defeat Witness Lee. As such, they set aside a book that they had originally written to accuse Brother Nee. We learned this after a careful investigation following their attack on us. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="es0cmqmo2bSRPlzoYg6jE-vfJImtSuAECQ4Od9WJoRLWDAAHi3ihQKAdbCEaWCGO-" class="head2">Concerning the Triune God</h2><p data-content-id="5e00GL6X4KTLTe6gGn6_rcLgRbPwvxTnt8Wxmh9g5ym_N0v0LlYgm9FG101PxmZf7"> Between 1972 and 1973 they decided to write a book to attack <span id="470" data-page-id="470" class="pg">[470]</span> and condemn me. They condemned me for damaging the doctrine concerning the Trinity, citing the councils held in the first five centuries. The Trinity is truly a mystery, and it has been the subject of much debate among theologians throughout the ages. After all the debates, two extreme schools of thought were rejected: modalism and tritheism. Modalism was exemplified by Sabellius, whose followers were known as Sabellianists. They saw a little from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="288324" data-verses="Isaiah 9:1">Isaiah 9</span> that the Son is the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="288325" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">v. 6</span>); they also saw a little from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="288326" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> that Christ is the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="288327" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">v. 17</span>); furthermore, they saw a little from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="288328" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span>, where the Lord said, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="288329" data-verses="John 14:9">v. 9</span>), and that the Father will send the Comforter, who is the Spirit of reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="288330" data-verses="John 15:26">15:26</span>). Although they acknowledged these verses, they claimed that God originally was only the Father, but He ceased to exist when the Son came; then they claimed that the Son also ceased to exist when the Spirit came. Thus, they denied the eternal coexistence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. </p>
    <p data-content-id="NUpkgYfUZdfz2S8sOLj4aZRyb3SAeArJ8LUXE3_WjySO1W07WzzNj-NP1gGLM_dUS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="288331" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> God said, “Let Us make man in Our image.” Although the Son had not yet been incarnated, the Father, Son, and Spirit—the “Us”—were coexisting; They coexist simultaneously. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="288332" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> says, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We [the Father and the Son] will come to him and make an abode with him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="288333" data-verses="John 14:23">v. 23</span>). This shows that the Son and the Father coexist simultaneously. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="288334" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">Second Corinthians 13:14</span>, even more explicitly indicates the coexistence of the Father, Son, and Spirit, speaking of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit being with us all. Modalism is an erroneous doctrine because it states that the Father, Son, and Spirit do not coexist. When people hear that the Son is the Father, and Christ is the Spirit, they think of modalism because they are not clear concerning the truth of the Divine Trinity. </p>
    <p data-content-id="tI7Ub_4jfQam8vOe1uM66RLuYHKt0qH8U5z_LHubj3OKaXHdz-uSvO6o-z_ds5nHF"> Those in Christianity know that the Bible speaks of the unique God. Hence, they say that there is one God. However, the Bible also says that this one God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Thus, these ones also think of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as three persons. Their mind cannot comprehend the truth concerning the Divine Trinity. The Divine Trinity is truly a mystery; He is three-yet-one, one-yet-three; He is triune. If He were not one, how could He be the unique God? If He were not three, how could He say, “Let Us”? How can we reconcile these two aspects of the Divine Trinity? <span id="471" data-page-id="471" class="pg">[471]</span> Many theologians throughout the generations have tried to reconcile these two aspects. Some people do not give ground to the Bible but instead give ground to their own mind, which leads them to say that there are three Gods. Although Christians do not speak generally about three Gods, many believe subconsciously that there are three Gods. </p>
    <p data-content-id="hcp9m1FuBp-Zy6-jymgYnfjCRwAKU-SxMh2VrxrTY-KZdwgts5GsA_kBU_g3yadT1"> Before I heard Brother Nee’s speaking concerning the Triune God, I also thought that there were three Gods because I was taught in Christianity to pray to the Father, not to the Son. I was told to pray to the Father in the name of the Son. Since the Spirit was regarded primarily as a source of inspiration, I was further taught to pray to the Father in the name of the Son by the inspiration of the Spirit. Whenever I knelt down to pray, I had to be very careful to remember to say, “O Father, O heavenly Father!” If I made a mistake, I would confess my mistake and ask for forgiveness from the Father. </p>
    <p data-content-id="U8D6BQZotIxg1IgGVeQTDzORZXBApldezGducnG4ov5SfyZRN_eCT_HJWZRQgbaA6"> When they debate, theologians who advocate tritheism end up falling into modalism, and those who advocate modalism end up becoming tritheists in order to recognize the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. They never stop arguing. After I arrived in the United States, I stressed very much the Son being the Father and Christ being the Spirit. This was unbearable to the people at EOC. Thus, they “studied” my books and said that I taught modalism. They even cited my illustration of a watermelon as evidence to support their claim. They said that Witness Lee compares the Father to a watermelon, the Son to watermelon slices, and the Spirit to watermelon juice. In order for a big watermelon to get into our stomach, it has to be cut into slices. Moreover, the slices of watermelon needed to be pressed to produce watermelon juice. Once we drink watermelon juice, both the slices of watermelon and the watermelon itself get into us. They said that this was modalism. </p>
    <p data-content-id="MChS44jzGMa4wRjXH-mu8h2LZNeoVxO4pq0LdHaEgVl-OB8IGPvPO0OZfb-lHo1zt"> If they thought that I taught modalism, then all the more Brother Nee taught modalism. In <em>Hymns,</em> #490, which was written by Brother Nee, stanza 5 says, “Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called, / But now the Holy Spirit art; / The Spirit is Thine other form, / Thyself to dwell within our heart.” Is this modalism? Brother Nee did not say that when the Son came, the Father ceased to exist, and when the Spirit came, the Son ceased to exist. Thus, I hope that every one of you will carefully study <em>Hymns,</em> #489, #490, #491, and <span id="472" data-page-id="472" class="pg">[472]</span> #492; these four hymns are full of revelation. I was attacked for saying that Christ is a God-man and that we, who are in Christ, have become many God-men. The opposers said that I teach that every Christian can become God and that I am making myself God. They said that we teach deification in the sense that man can become an object of worship. They also said that we make the church a God because I said that God is no longer three-in-one but four-in-one, that is, the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the church. Thus, they implied that I say that the church can become an object of worship. They misjudged us. </p>
    <p data-content-id="V7aDZxBlTqThMzqEGUHc_rEE6higcErVaUPL_odu_5ddW1yS-KSIBH78AGF5Kxj3Q"> Even before their book was completed, the EOC divided into two groups: one group wrote the book entitled <em>The Mindbenders,</em> published in 1977, and the other group wrote <em>The God-Men,</em> published in 1981. Both books contained many slanderous and damaging things, not matters of truth that could be debated. In order to expedite the distribution of <em>The Mindbenders,</em> a bishop among the EOC even joined the editorial board of Thomas Nelson, a large publishing company in American Christianity, in order to motivate the publisher to publish this book. This company is a well-known publisher of Christian books in America. Thus, the publication of this book stirred up a wave of opposition against us in America. This book was the focus of our battle. </p>
    <p data-content-id="ien0waqxaF4oFwsBQquNZnNNHeKmGjhQXVoGXCNBtrK7Qqn8Rl6GZS6YY6ZqgP0IJ"> We responded with books that refuted the erroneous statements concerning the Triune God. I even challenged the opposers, saying, “You believe in two divine Fathers, two life-giving Spirits, and three Gods.” Based on the Bible I pointed out their errors in regard to the faith, and they were not able to refute my points. This battle is still going on. However, I thank the Lord because, according to my observation, we have more than a seventy percent increase on college campuses because the truth is on our side. You need to pray for us. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="14CNNJ9eRuzbAFhrK1-JnJOo_FZxhrDlm2JwlF4osQa1vLFcwZeN86DPwyj8b8Puf" class="head2">Concerning the Ground of Locality</h2><p data-content-id="9636w8hfrN2orMkPf2S0syNfDF67twPmhFwZcGFdEXn99lnoFAvQDiJtjeey8JPgH"> The EOC also accused us of saying that only those who are in the local churches in the Lord’s recovery are the church. They distorted facts and spread false rumors in the process of attacking us, saying that the local churches are “Witness Lee’s churches” and that we teach that those who are not in his “churches” are not saved. This false speaking easily stirred up others to oppose us because Christian sects today generally call themselves “churches.” During my first visit <span id="473" data-page-id="473" class="pg">[473]</span> to Las Vegas, as soon as I entered the city, I saw a sign on the road saying that it had such-and-such number of people and such-and-such number of “churches.” Cities boast of having a large number of “churches.” Anaheim has many schools, many parks, and many “churches.” </p>
    <p data-content-id="jLf_-2fX6UmbfbE4Q4AcpCOUp5u-jgfC7QxT2_QPblvl3xGgjseqIZ3dCxJGm3JqC"> Since World War II there has been a trend of establishing small “churches” whenever people are not happy with the place where they meet. It has become easy to invite a few other believers to sing hymns and pray in a home. Hence, there are “churches” everywhere. Although these groups do not cooperate with one another and even compete with one another, they still acknowledge one another as a church. We are the only ones who say that only those who are on the local ground are the church practically; this is intolerable to them. </p>
    <p data-content-id="TZPjD3eaAEvknfaoPr30YtfQ2DvSS09fMu2kgW8C8PhkmH_vdQbjm-9xclyF_2L1h"> The truth that we speak concerning the church is not as simple as their understanding. According to the light in the Word, every Christian in a locality is part of the church in that locality. For example, <em>the church in Taipei</em> refers to all the Christians in the city of Taipei. Although many Christians meet in various denominations, they are still a part of the church. However, the place where they meet cannot be called the church. This can be likened to a big family. Of the many members in a family, three may have gone abroad, five may be working elsewhere, and six may be taking care of their own affairs, leaving only six people at home. All these ones are part of the family. Those who are outside the home are members of the family, but they are not staying with the family. The six people staying at home are not only members of the family; they are simply the family. People who meet in the Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church, and groups that speak in tongues are a part of the church. However, the places where they meet cannot be considered as the church. </p>
    <p data-content-id="ncOAZQUsBQTDzVA6wlRcAXIHyvpiFEW4Qt-PcuKAWt7INkVOhM8zDw54YNMNzHMNN"> The battle for the truth that we are now fighting in the United States is mainly focused on the Triune God and the ground of the church. When I first came, I spoke of Christ being our food, of Christ being our living water, of Christ being our garment, of Christ being our light, and of Christ being our Sabbath, new moon, and feasts, that is, of Christ being the reality of all positive things. Consequently, people claimed that I was teaching polytheism and pantheism. No one talks about this now. All their attention is focused on the Triune God and the ground of the church. <span id="474" data-page-id="474" class="pg">[474]</span> </p>
    <p data-content-id="6pOSsROSZcsSLSaM_do4O0YZyzpzvu4ztMs8IVbchUgzgvD4PjZDMw_O4npH3AKVU"> Thus, people began to study what we said concerning the Triune God. They also studied the matter of the church from our books. From our books, they could see that the first church in the New Testament, the church in Jerusalem, was a local church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="288335" data-verses="Acts 8:1">Acts 8:1</span>), and the church in Antioch was also a local church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="288336" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span>). The book of Revelation also speaks of seven local churches in seven cities in Asia Minor, which was a province (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="288337" data-verses="Revelation 1:11">1:11</span>). Even up to today, no orthodox theologian or proper professor of theology has written a book to refute us. Every scholar who genuinely observes the situation realizes that it would be impossible for an old Chinese man to publish book after book at the rate of four messages per week if there was no content. My speaking on the Triune God and the local churches is fully orthodox. If they tried to argue with me, I would present the revelation in the Bible, and they would be defeated. Hence, they do not dare to try to refute these two points of truth. </p>
    <p data-content-id="RZlPxLfziMHc9UDCBnLtc7PnE6QbLw0vBcRXGaTy5tEkCAmz5zs9o6JVED5YHHUof"> Now, when some radio stations in America broadcast programs related to the Bible, they use terms found in our books. They also talk about the human spirit. Some even broadcast messages without making any changes to our speaking. Billy Graham’s magazine <em>Decision</em> printed an article that said that the best way to read the Bible is by prayer and that it would be even better to “pray-read.” As long as something is good, others will adopt it. We have diamonds in our pocket, and others want them. Someone even wrote an exposition of the book of Romans using our materials. It is a pity that the author was not honest, using our things but not informing us or citing his source. Sooner or later, people will know that those materials come from us. </p>
    <p data-content-id="s0IM7um95aIDSEQmkz8SiZ6iB7UzFFOw2MHw1MC2Fhe-T7ym_8ndik756xygk_O9v"> I truly have faith that if the Lord delays His return by another five or ten years, these truths will be acknowledged by Christians in the United States, because the truth is the truth. For a long time, the Roman Catholic Church preached that salvation was by the works of man, and it even sold letters of indulgence to deceive people into giving money. One day, however, Martin Luther rose up and spoke on justification by faith according to the Bible. Although many people attacked him in the beginning, Christians eventually acknowledged that justification by faith is the truth. Hence, the truth of Christ being the mystery of God and of the church being the mystery of Christ will become commonplace one day. At that time all the “laymen” in Christianity will speak the “language of the <span id="475" data-page-id="475" class="pg">[475]</span> experts” in the Lord’s recovery. Hallelujah, this is the history of the Lord’s recovery. </p>
    <p data-content-id="wyEUpIjwSXJsd3rz3tPe0UI6RY79uCduVqUUV_xXoFBAZUKt_73dH_FG3FxIS5325"> I hope that all the young people will study these truths. You should not simply go out and show off your diamonds, because the Lord Jesus said, “Neither cast your pearls before the hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="288338" data-verses="Matthew 7:6">Matt. 7:6</span>). Today there is truth in the Lord’s recovery. The content of the Lord’s recovery is not simple, and you must spend time to study it. At the same time we are also actively publishing books so that those who are investigating and studying us will have to keep reading our books. Please pray for this matter because the Lord’s victory in the United States is His victory in the whole world. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="LZrYPLdTOsOOl1yiE5KRtNK6NJiNRseI6G1kRV9PtNmWFg19exmtPtPJtWwirAeLF" class="head1">THE PRESENT SITUATION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS<br>OF THE LORD’S RECOVERY IN VARIOUS PLACES<br>OF THE UNITED STATES</h2><p data-content-id="mbyps54m2PchesLsYPdZW8rFty_pVHU2t6gG22-tlUerWUf_0f931Akp2vScFCgAl"> Presently, the situation in the United States can be divided into a few major regions. In California on the West Coast, stretching from Los Angeles in the south to San Francisco in the north, the Bay Area, there are about twenty-one churches with one thousand six to seven hundred people. This area is where the work of the Lord’s recovery in America began. Most of the churches were raised up as a result of this work. </p>
    <p data-content-id="ZmwMsa-cINJTGUaNWYSRA382yDpKPcBTE0m1E2pyZLoOWWkJiOhP5-k11_p_USDKQ"> In the South there is Texas. In the beginning, there were very few saints in Texas. In 1963 and 1964 I was invited to speak in Dallas, which is a central city in Texas. I went there three to four times and was very much welcomed. During my last visit the people who invited me observed the situation and realized that I was about to speak on the matter of the church. Thus, my host made a request, saying, “Brother Lee, the people here do not have sufficient capacity in life; please do not speak on the matter of the church.” However, after speaking for five to six days, there was a pressing burden within me on the last night; hence, I asked everyone to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="288339" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span>. The hosts knew immediately that I was going to speak on the Body of Christ and on the church, and they lowered their heads. After speaking in this way, they never invited me again. Nevertheless, on that night a young man, a student who was not yet married, was gained by the Lord. Although people rejected me at that meeting, the Lord gained one person. Because this brother was gained by the Lord, <span id="476" data-page-id="476" class="pg">[476]</span> there are now more than one thousand people meeting in about ten places in the Texas area. This is the Lord’s doing. </p>
    <p data-content-id="Aoj6LJyg-I5wHlc_OGukP19sIlRXbC9EaPkQF_RJlZvz-9iPS-Eh3ZqXTgnLU-2l3"> In the Northwest about seventy saints migrated to Seattle from Yorba Linda, an area near Los Angeles in Southern California. As a result, the surrounding churches were strengthened. Presently, there are about seven to eight hundred saints. Including those in Vancouver, Canada, there are close to one thousand saints in about ten churches. In the Midwest region, including Chicago, Illinois, and Cleveland, Ohio, there are more than ten churches and more than one thousand saints. In the Northeast, which stretches from Washington D.C. to Boston, there are less than ten churches and between six and eight hundred saints. </p>
    <p data-content-id="F5iGEBvLuhlzhn_TdzfDb5nTPAAjEHQzBSlDR2djIceXFGRW_EeUGQEKR0cg7oQGY"> In the Southeast region, there are two cities, Raleigh and Goldsboro in North Carolina, where some saints have migrated. South Carolina and North Carolina have many godly Christians. The people there love the Lord very much, seek the truth, and are of good character. Further south, there is a church in Atlanta, Georgia. There are also churches in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. On the whole, there are close to eighty churches and seven thousand saints in the United States. Although the truth is being debated, we truly believe that this debate will benefit all Christians in the United States because we are presenting the mysteries in the depths of the Bible. When they have some understanding of the truth, the tide of opposition will subside. </p>
    <p data-content-id="CWDwAjyI0qKY1hVLVvQHT50kSbhLOSegy4qRfDgTRiAg2B94KaBtmYQAig0TMGtMC"> The Lord’s arrangement is very good. There are churches in almost all the important regions in America. These churches are located one thousand five hundred miles to the east, to the west, and to the north of Texas. Hence, Texas will be a hub in the future. For this reason, apart from the ministry station in Anaheim, there is also a branch station in Irving near Dallas, Texas. In the future a dormitory for the trainings will be built at the ministry station in Texas. Starting from 1982, the semiannual trainings in the United States will be held in Anaheim, California, in the summer and in Irving, Texas, in the winter. Therefore, I still stay in Texas for about four months every year to provide some training and guidance. </p>
