    <p data-content-id="EAvOmg_sWjPgt1hDOUHsNYNUvEZCJDaeWIFjWgQjSHXMfLmpjFjuj7P4434vsAguI"> Sixty years ago [1920] the Lord started His recovery among us through Brother Watchman Nee. Today we will look again at the start of the Lord’s recovery in China. By the Lord’s grace, we have to bow our heads and say that the foundation laid by Brother Nee was absolutely correct. People cannot cheat history, because history uses time to test and prove the real situation. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="D9KUdi_no0eRPkcjlvhx9JmYce7_tnIt4aqXfXwv8EY1cGihvg2Krd4iCqUQot_i2" class="head1">THE REVELATIONS GIVEN TO US BY THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="SWyxoso-wsZbMNWh1AYeh7ocRgzftzgzkfAWjmC6gG4b2Fl0VFFVRr-Mzb4DNsvi6"> Over the past sixty years the Lord has given us fifty items of revelation. Most of them were brought in through Brother Nee. The Lord revealed item after item to him, and he released them in a timely manner. These included the assurance of salvation, the deviations in Christianity, the church, denominationalism, the clergy system and hierarchy, the universal priesthood, the presbytery with the proper eldership, baptism, the Lord’s table, the overcomers, the overcoming life of Christ, and so forth. From 1920 to 1932 there was a significant amount of revelation concerning positive items such as salvation, Christ, the church, and the kingdom. Negatively, we also became very clear concerning Christianity and denominationalism. </p>
    <p data-content-id="gMRP6oLRCKOOeXy92nE8xWUQ6FHGCR2TBckzIb4y6UE5DfpvOJytKzoRfjKtTAGf6"> After 1933 Brother Nee saw the matter of the Lord’s Body being expressed in locality after locality as local churches. The local church should not only have adequate content, which is its spiritual life, but must also have an accurate and definite ground, which is the ground of oneness, the oneness of the Body of Christ. One city should have only one church. In other words, the content within the church is Christ, and the ground without is the oneness of the Body. Both must exist at the same time. The outward ground must be definite, and the inward content must be full. In those years we saw clearly the matters of the boundary of the local church and the ground of the local church. By 1939 Brother Nee became very clear that the church <span id="382" data-page-id="382" class="pg"></span> should be practically built up. Without the practical building up of the church, the reality of the church would be a mere theory. These revelations did not come from Christianity but from God. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="es0cmqmo2bSRPlzoYg6jE-vfJImtSuAECQ4Od9WJoQLWFSQHi3ihQKAdbCEaWCGO-" class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE PRACTICALITY<br>OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="5e00GL6X4KTLTe6gGn6_rcLgRbPwvxTnt8Wxmh9g5zm_EnP0LlYgm9FG101PxmZf7"> Brother Nee and I both came out of Christianity. I am a fourth-generation Christian. The Christianity background of Brother Nee was even deeper because his grandfather was a pastor. Both of us were under the deep influence of Christianity. After seeing the light, we left the denominations and started to meet according to the revelation of the Bible. However, we did not know how to meet. At that time Brother Nee came in contact with the teachings and practices of the Brethren. Comparatively speaking, the way of the Brethren was an improvement over the way of the denominations, so we adopted the Brethren way unconsciously. </p>
    <p data-content-id="NUpkgYfUZdfz2S8sOLj4aZRyb3SAeArJ8LUXE3_WjzSO9FE7WzzNj-NP1gGLM_dUS"> The hymns we sang in the beginning years were the hymns sung in the denominations, some of which were not appropriate. Brother Nee collected almost all the hymns of the denominations, including hymns from the Presbyterians, the Baptists, the Methodists, the Anglican Church, and others. Brother Nee selected about one hundred seventy hymns out of more than ten thousand hymns, and he retranslated them. He also added a few hymns that he wrote himself and one written by Sister Ruth Lee. There were a total of one hundred eighty-four hymns. </p>
    <p data-content-id="_2ImBFFRntdiH8OGMJDf8Np5wcPD8sAyyp3Uf2QSpUlW62Y-ZKxlACUERtRbKP7EW"> When he was compiling the hymns, he used the organization of the Brethren hymnal. The Brethren called their hymnal <em>Hymns for the Little Flock.</em> Brother Nee translated this title into Chinese and used it for the hymnal that he compiled. Initially, the Western missionaries did not know how to designate us. When they saw that our hymnal had <em>Hymns</em> in big letters and <em>Little Flock</em> in small letters on the side, they designated us “The Little Flock.” This was the reason some people subsequently called us “The Little Flock.” We repeatedly declared that <em>Little Flock</em> was a title on our hymnal, not our name, and that we should not be called “The Church of the Little Flock.” Nevertheless, people still called us “The Little Flock.” In 1934 Brother Nee decided to remove the words <em>Little Flock</em> from the cover of our hymnal. From that time on, our hymnals bear only the word <em>Hymns.</em> <span id="383" data-page-id="383" class="pg"></span> </p>
    <p data-content-id="BfEGB8Ng0Wvl4DskaOdHYWRAKAI6I_d88YGSOGs69lcGQKWZf6g3K_QFuPsYfJumS"> Not only was the hymnal called <em>Hymns for the Little Flock,</em> which was from the Brethren, but even the categories in the table of contents, such as “Words of Praise” and “Gospel Trumpet,” were translated from <em>Hymns for the Little Flock</em> of the Brethren. Brother Nee also added two or three more categories. Due to the Brethren’s ignorance of spiritual warfare and lack of the subjective experience of the cross, their hymnal did not have these two categories. Brother Nee added these two categories because he had much experience related to these two matters. For hymns regarding the subjective experience of the cross, he translated hymns written by Brother A. B. Simpson and those with him. In the beginning we were not able to completely turn from traditional things in Christianity, such as how to meet. </p>
    <p data-content-id="xThQOhsRpZcWf7p_o41UvBQCDZ2S9fLB_rKLTdnQJzjJoOW5FKuJuJLnfNI_o5_cS"> However, among the denominations or even among the Brethren, there had never been messages about the practical building up of the local churches. The practical building up involves elders and deacons serving in coordination, co-workers coordinating with elders and deacons in a locality, and saints coordinating with one another and practically serving under the leading and care of the elders and deacons. These matters cannot be found in Christianity. Brother Nee saw these matters, and he started practicing them in the church in Shanghai. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="rH2Q06ASyQ6-MH4ccpJnobG71ogca8Xt2hfM_dbpEJZl1plfSubQaEZAdt-1gIijm" class="head1">SEEING THE BLUEPRINT<br>OF THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="dnhNpwwCrsx0qLJsXW_tJK95OafVqlxnHVv9b2diZm9QMN-wG-zn9qdrWkTvMwVUA"> In 1940 I was at Yu-hwa Village in Shanghai for a training by Brother Nee. One day he said to me, “Brother Witness, we have the blueprint of God’s plan in our hand. We know how to build.” I was surprised to hear that there was a blueprint. I wanted to see it. Actually, he was speaking of a spiritual blueprint. When I asked him about this blueprint, he spoke to me in detail because he truly wanted to perfect me. He said that we should have the practical service of the elders, because it was not enough for the elders to have fellowship with everyone in a general way, decide how many meetings to have in a week, lead the opening of a meeting, and dismiss the meetings with some announcements. There was no true, practical, and coordinated service. </p>
    <p data-content-id="QntV8KqUiuC9AdU2_go4DYo2f9LheLtZN7A0HY1jmNrDVU8T6kVmKkFTIk9jPZsbf"> In regard to practice he said that we should set up an elders’ room as an office for the elders and train the brothers and sisters to come <span id="384" data-page-id="384" class="pg"></span> to the elders. Thus, the elders should be in the elders’ room often. Second, we should train the elders not to sit in the chairs as if they were on a throne; they should work there and sit with others to have proper fellowship. When the brothers and sisters have difficulties, the elders should know how to help them with their problems. They have to know how to give a drink to the thirsty ones and how to feed the hungry ones. They have to be learning constantly. At the same time, because most people have Saturdays off, the elders should be available for three to four hours every Saturday so that the brothers and sisters can come. They have to meet the need of everyone who comes. </p>
    <p data-content-id="KeZnFzRHwqS5R1XPrhdsbIFJEyDLX9x9-_kL5FapDkVSCkrhRoc72TrIcB9GMvbL3"> This is now a common practice among us, but I never heard such a word before that conversation with Brother Nee. Nevertheless, there are still some places that do not have such a practice—there is no elders’ room, and the brothers and sisters are not accustomed to approaching the elders. Approaching the elders involves troubles. The brothers and sisters approach the elders because they have troubles, difficulties, and problems. Many people want to become an elder, but they do not know how troublesome it is to be an elder. An elder is like a doctor who must always be on call to help people in an emergency. In order for the elders to serve practically, the brothers and sisters must be able to come to them. </p>
    <p data-content-id="lpzEm1z_N3y10s47txSAKMWli2nuWjPHOevoJ24Hc4bCSLb3DJldRSHH13IT5r6_R"> Brother Nee also told me about the service of the service office. He said that the deacons must set up a service office and take turns being in the office. Every day there should be at least one person in the office so that the brothers and sisters can come to the meeting hall to fellowship about personal matters. Some people may need to find a house, some may have lost a job, and all these ones should come and fellowship in the service office. The service office should also have a few desks so that the deacons can come and take care of business matters. They should also bring in some serving ones so that the saints know how to use the service office and make the office the hub of the church service. Brother Nee spoke with great interest concerning the practical service of the church. I listened to him carefully and remembered his points. Even though he had not built up the matters contained in the blueprint at that time, I saw the blueprint, and I saw that he had been trying to build according to this blueprint from the beginning. <span id="385" data-page-id="385" class="pg"></span> </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="Ob1XxueNYrJfjnt0HQ_3JyK0i40MoHiY98Hs1tuay5DQiuLawdrq7jq0kSR56mezY" class="head1">THE SERVICE PRACTICED IN THE CHURCH IN CHEFOO</h2><p data-content-id="4R0TY5J9soMjXqbOitjQUAtg0v6n2EXcPZCye_OVwaM-iHYt0_z-oL3BLtpvC5BKI"> After the training concluded, I returned to Chefoo, and I fellowshipped with the brothers concerning the need for the church in Chefoo to set up the elders’ office and the service office. I also spoke about the practical services of the elders, the deacons, and the entire church. Thus, I began to arrange for the setting up of the elders’ office and the service office. I designed the arrangement of the fellowship room with its utensils, coffee table, and sofa. At that time I also designed the emblem “In Christ.” This emblem was on the microphone, bed sheets, and pillow cases; all the utensils in the meeting hall were marked with the emblem of “In Christ.” </p>
    <p data-content-id="oexBIGjUiBWO_zEX2GfL-_3nJWqzvhqGsfAAPaYz8-udrpsTnxPfeRe46bxF8rQjP"> The hospitality rooms were truly beautiful. In a blue room the furnishings were all blue; the bed sheets were blue, and the pillow cases were blue. In a green room everything was green; there was also a white room, and so forth. At that time the meeting hall of the church in Chefoo was an old two-story house. The main room was used for meetings, and there were wing rooms on both sides. I rearranged every room; even the toilets were drawn, designed, and made by my own hands. They were truly tidy. We placed the water for washing hands outside, and we taught brothers and sisters regarding sanitation. </p>
    <p data-content-id="3-9HQR_eqbE-JHIqPd3VLZPOqfKBJHaLymPbUYbIbhXcCqvOR8z5L9d0lkBaJRRQf"> Brothers Chang Wu-chen and Chu Hsun-min were brought in at that time to learn to be deacons. They frequently served in shifts in the service office. The service office was neat and tidy; all the documents and articles were placed in drawers in an orderly manner so that it was possible to find things without turning on the lights. The fellowship rooms were well furnished. </p>
    <p data-content-id="GOnMzePzOGmLIUM1LNpUNfFpvOCOPhV4Nx3sot2-CwDl7RXF1jY-GteSVbcorFP8M"> The effectiveness of this service arrangement for the practice of the church between 1940 and 1942 was first seen in the gospel preaching of the whole church, in which all the brothers and sisters coordinated together, and people were baptized by the hundreds. By the end of 1942 this practical and coordinated service brought in a great revival. At that time in mainland China, there were a few hundred churches, but only Shanghai and Chefoo had a practical service. Among the co-workers, only Watchman Nee had such a practice in the church in Shanghai, and I had the same practice in the church in Chefoo. Other localities did not have such a practice. </p>
    <p data-content-id="cHZzSBzYL-9llZweBFLKyU-_WNLkNScatSPEEVE9IvV9ERWuRDOjjt8aOpwzFbCPG"> In the fall of 1942 the church in Shanghai had a great turmoil, <span id="386" data-page-id="386" class="pg"></span> and Brother Nee had no way to minister. In addition, due to the oppression of the Japanese army, the meetings were stopped. Brother Nee moved with the Sheng-Hwa pharmaceutical factory to Chungking. When his ministry was recovered in 1948, he said with a heavy heart, “No one can hinder what the Lord would do.” He said that the practical service that started in the church in Shanghai was disrupted in 1942 and derailed at a midway point. Nevertheless, the Lord worked it out in Chefoo. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="YPDMZ_z3G3XoDxA_J_bv04wp56nRZfe4iKf85nsQqRcQSwMviXX_2tDkSCmyEOLfD" class="head1">THE PRACTICAL SERVICE IN THE CHURCH IN SHANGHAI</h2><p data-content-id="EAvOmg_sWjPgt1hDOUHsNYNUvEZCJDaeWIFjWgQjSHXMeYWpjFjuj7P4434vsAguI"> Before the resumption of Brother Nee’s ministry, the meetings in the church in Shanghai were resumed in 1946. I received an invitation to Shanghai, and he also returned to Shanghai. We had many opportunities to fellowship, and I fellowshipped with him about our experience in 1940, hoping that he would not find anything unsuitable. After I spoke, he encouraged me and said, “This is what every church needs. By the Lord’s grace, we must spread this practice to every place.” </p>
    <p data-content-id="D9KUdi_no0eRPkcjlvhx9JmYce7_tnIt4aqXfXwv8EY1aVihvg2Krd4iCqUQot_i2"> Consequently, I practiced this way boldly in the church in Shanghai. For the practical service Brother Nee renovated the meeting hall of the church in Shanghai, including the elders’ office, the service office, the hospitality rooms, and the staircase of the second floor. Continuing with the foundation laid by Brother Nee, I strengthened it further. I can say that I opened two “factories” according to the original “blueprint” of Brother Nee—one in Chefoo and another in Shanghai. These two places were experiments. Even though the situation was not bad, we still encountered some unworkable practices in these experiments. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="SWyxoso-wsZbMNWh1AYeh7ocRgzftzgzkfAWjmC6gG4bxW10VFFVRr-Mzb4DNsvi6" class="head1">THE PRACTICES IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES<br>IN TAIWAN AND SOUTHEAST ASIA</h2><p data-content-id="gMRP6oLRCKOOeXy92nE8xWUQ6FHGCR2TBckzIb4y6UE5HPJvOJytKzoRfjKtTAGf6"> After we came to Taiwan in 1949, I started to lead the service in the church in Taipei. The first few years were truly in one accord. Everyone was in submission, and this brought in a tremendous propagation. During the first year alone, there was an increase of severalfold. In five years the number of saints in Taiwan increased from three to five hundred to more than twenty thousand. At the same time all the services were on track. There was an elders’ office and a service office with saints taking turns to work in the office. <span id="387" data-page-id="387" class="pg"></span> Even though the arrangement of the elders’ office and the service office was very plain, there was the reality of practical service, and many blessings were realized. </p>
    <p data-content-id="es0cmqmo2bSRPlzoYg6jE-vfJImtSuAECQ4Od9WJoQLWACgHi3ihQKAdbCEaWCGO-"> When I went to Southeast Asia to lead the churches into the practical service, however, it did not work. Although the leading co-worker in Manila said that he would hand over the leading of the church to me, I had a little doubt about whether his handing over was reliable. Nevertheless, when I started to serve the Lord, I learned from Brother Nee to accept what others say. He spoke of the example of Judas cheating the Lord Jesus. During his time with the Lord, Judas no doubt stole money from the bag, and even though the Lord Jesus knew this, He still let Judas keep the money bag and manage the money. Brother Nee told us to not question the words of our fellow serving brothers. </p>
    <p data-content-id="5e00GL6X4KTLTe6gGn6_rcLgRbPwvxTnt8Wxmh9g5zm_P1v0LlYgm9FG101PxmZf7"> Because I received this teaching from Brother Nee, I accepted the co-worker’s word and rearranged each service. Because I could not find an appropriate brother, I arranged for Sister Chen and Sister Ong to be responsible for the service office. When I was there, there were no problems; but once I left Manila and returned to Taiwan, the brother who handed over the leadership to me overturned everything that I had arranged. This false compliance made it impossible for the two sisters to do anything. Therefore, in Manila I was not able to work out the practical service. </p>
    <p data-content-id="NUpkgYfUZdfz2S8sOLj4aZRyb3SAeArJ8LUXE3_WjzSO3X07WzzNj-NP1gGLM_dUS"> I was able to work it out in three places—Chefoo, Shanghai, and Taiwan—and what I learned resulted in positive experiences. In Manila, where I could not work it out, I also gained an experience, a negative experience. After these experiences I went to the United States. By this time I was adequately equipped, rich in experience, and familiar with the blueprint. Therefore, I knew what would be effective and what would be ineffective, what practices to keep and what practices to drop. In the move from mainland China to Taiwan, I had already dropped some unsuitable methods. After arriving in America, I dropped other unsuitable methods, making the practice in America simpler and more practical than in Taiwan. It was effective and quick. </p>
    <p data-content-id="tI7Ub_4jfQam8vOe1uM66RLuYHKt0qH8U5z_LHubj2OKYWHdz-uSvO6o-z_ds5nHF"> For example, in mainland China, whenever a saint went to a new place to meet, he needed a letter of introduction, and there would also be an introduction in the meeting; but this could not be applied in America. During the initial stage in America, everyone who came <span id="388" data-page-id="388" class="pg"></span> to our meetings was saved, and everyone was pursuing and loving the Lord. Nevertheless, among the Brethren in America, the matter of introducing and receiving saints was practiced very strictly. Any person who went to their meeting had to have a letter of introduction. If a person forgot to bring it, he could not go inside to break the bread, and he had to sit outside and wait to be introduced. Even if everyone knew that he was saved and truly loved the Lord, he could not break the bread without a letter of introduction. He had to go through their process of introduction. Such a practice in America caused many Christians to feel unhappy. Realizing this, I knew that continuing such a practice would give people the impression that we were taking the way of the Brethren, and it would kill them. Therefore, we did not use letters of introduction, nor did we introduce people. </p>
    <p data-content-id="hcp9m1FuBp-Zy6-jymgYnfjCRwAKU-SxMh2VrxrTY_KZfxgts5GsA_kBU_g3yadT1"> Furthermore, there was absolutely no regulation in the way we met and in the activities of the meetings. In the past I said that the Lord’s table meeting should have two parts—the first part for remembering the Lord and the second part for worshipping the Father. I also spoke on hymns that were suitable for the first half and hymns that were suitable for the second half. Sometimes I corrected someone who made an unsuitable choice. I do not regret this teaching, because we needed it at that time. But over a long period of time, such a practice can become dead letters. </p>
