    <p data-content-id="yIJ51a1bFchL7SNS_c7ZbvAGicOEbRPJCx9Zl0XbkHULYdVL0SbvP-oxNuIaAe2Dc">According to the New Testament, the death of Christ on the cross accomplished many things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487183" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> we see that He gave Himself in order to abolish the ordinances for the creation of the one new man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487184" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">Galatians 1</span> we see that Christ gave Himself for our sins for the purpose of rescuing us out of religion, out of the present evil age.</p>
    <p data-content-id="8dBuSopZm16j3LCbMbeQ_ETFGlMT9HPHJscwLelykGcZ0AsUwhCBB7wAl5r98UMCJ">We should apply <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487185" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span> not only to the Galatian believers but also to today’s believers in Christ. Most Christians are held in some kind of religious fold. Although in the New Testament the term <em>fold</em> is not positive, certain Christian hymns speak of being brought back to the fold in some kind of positive sense. We have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487186" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> the fold denotes Judaism. In principle, Catholicism and all the denominations are folds. Only the church is God’s flock. Christ has brought us back to the flock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487187" data-verses="John 10:16">John 10:16</span>), not to the fold. Many of us can testify that we have been rescued out of the fold and brought back to God’s flock.</p>
    <p data-content-id="0QU6n_wvA5F6iUYDEKiLkyx_IonCDp2taO8EWrVIDRIXfePd4SxgWFsryaZa-CUC7">At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487188" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span>, God’s people, His sheep, were in the fold of Judaism. But as this chapter makes clear, Christ came to bring His sheep out of the fold and to form them with the Gentile believers into one flock, the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487189" data-verses="John 10:16">v. 16</span>). Hence, the fold is religion, whereas the flock is the church. Today Catholicism and the denominations are folds that keep Christ’s sheep. But Christ is seeking to rescue His sheep out of the various religious folds and to bring them together as the one flock.</p>
    <p data-content-id="7QMMJN0S38w9VYs4RWW3Pdr8rKFIc93FCA6hwncGOSgrNv9t_td1jki749I99qv-Y">Christ’s death on the cross to deliver us from the present <span id="9" data-page-id="9" class="pg"></span> evil age was according to the will of God, the Father. To rescue the sheep from the fold is thus according to the will of God. Because Catholicism and the denominations damage the flock of God, they are opposed to the will of God. By building up their folds, they spoil the church life.</p>
    <p data-content-id="_1e0vjFI68MCcVZM-33iytHCTVUbT9bkVbhSc5iVkBzfbuaLgxnSoEBzFNtIoBNlu">Today the Lord is still endeavoring to bring His sheep out of the fold. For this reason a warfare is raging between religion and the Lord’s recovery. The Lord Jesus came not to steal the sheep but to lead the sheep out of the fold. The Judaizers, however, regarded Him as a sheep-stealer. In like manner, we in the Lord’s recovery are accused of proselytizing, of stealing sheep. Although we do not proselytize, we do desire that the Lord’s sheep may be led out of the fold and into the flock.</p>
    <p data-content-id="B975vS4XfDCPSG587QVTHjFBhmpL2x37O7XpU4Mx2q0YqXZDKPWIXV1Y7RDil_Hea">The Lord Jesus came into the fold, opened the door, and led the sheep out of the fold. The Judaizers crucified Him. But through His death on the cross, the Lord gave Himself for our sins in order to rescue us from the religious fold. The principle is the same both with the believers in Paul’s time and with us today.</p>
    <h2 data-content-id="xvYYq6aRA-9eRLuUGyqLMst4v12AhRa1tvkrYA5wHfstTGiYFQIMHxVVWju2zEJEd" class="head2">B. Paul Becoming an Apostle</h2><p data-content-id="rAqTS5gc3Z33VVmcZILiXWvy10HpRntuwOn-0yghHBtJWJwwIZ_V3dvcpgYBREgYj">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487190" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">Galatians 1:1</span> Paul speaks of his apostleship: “Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead).” Paul’s apostleship had much to do with the gospel that he preached. The purpose of the book of Galatians is to let those who receive it know that the gospel preached by the apostle Paul was not from man’s teaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487191" data-verses="Galatians 1:11">v. 11</span>) but from God’s revelation. Hence, at the very opening of this book, Paul emphasized the fact that he became an apostle not from men nor through man but through Christ and God.</p>
    <p data-content-id="d8zMDJr5spDVPmeFDkfUD1wqvTmm-nlj2_b0kQqwcrJQJMbKUd5BEd4wZEAltZnNi">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487192" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">verse 1</span>, as in the entire book, Paul is careful in his use of words. First, he says that he did not become an apostle “from men”; he goes on to say that his apostleship was not “through man.” He was made an apostle directly through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Christ from the dead. The law dealt with man as the old creation, whereas the gospel makes man the new creation in resurrection. God made <span id="10" data-page-id="10" class="pg"></span> Paul an apostle not by the law according to his natural man in the old creation but through the resurrection of Christ according to his regenerated man in the new creation. Hence, Paul does not say here, “God the Father, who gave the law through Moses,” but “God the Father, who raised Him from the dead.” God’s New Testament economy is not with men in the old creation but with men in the new creation through the resurrection of Christ. Paul’s apostleship belonged altogether to the new creation, which transpires in our spirit through regeneration by the Spirit of God.</p>
    <p data-content-id="Q0OuTtpBgv68zIXAYzTydWIIrVhLLduRqNsWr17aIVoabSM80VvP5hZ_PD92qzk58">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487193" data-verses="Galatians 1:2">verse 2</span> Paul goes on to speak of all the brothers who are with him. This indicates that he considered all the brothers with him co-writers that they might be a testimony and a confirmation of what he wrote in this Epistle.</p>
    <h2 data-content-id="KMsSshCndrO-iZ7CHu3b7OKJI4hznYhk80v9elkdiC1fYkgIai6Uxy6KaDUkSBvh9" class="head2">C. Grace and Peace to the Churches<br>from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</h2><p data-content-id="lOsxVPDHleZYALv08R2blC5pJxlEw3sLPyzrtHjCOYVBDS8rZqHKgwsUzb6QBIozn">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487194" data-verses="Galatians 1:3">verse 3</span> Paul says, “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” Grace is God as our enjoyment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487195" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487196" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Cor. 15:10</span>), and peace is the condition, the issue, that results from grace. Peace is the result of the enjoyment of God our Father. How good it is that grace and peace come to the churches from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
