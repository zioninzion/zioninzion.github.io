The messages were compiled into two parts. Part One consists of chapters 1 through 14, which were messages given in Hong Kong. Part Two consists of chapters 15 through 28, which were messages given in Taipei.</p>

    <p data-content-id="il5ppT3LRBHdh49w8vTnItmcmDyHmn8S520qsQwxjV1QLxGMl8udPJmJQ3nPIlR6E"> Training meetings are different from church meetings. In the meetings of the church no one requires anything of us, nor would anyone restrict us. Trainings, however, are full of requirements and restrictions. Therefore, in a training we must put ourselves aside and focus on receiving the training. We must put aside our concepts, understanding, choices, tendencies, and preferences. This means that apart from when we are eating and sleeping, we must daily use our time to fellowship concerning the things related to the training. In particular, we must pray concerning the central matter, the crucial points, and every small point mentioned in the training so that we may be filled with the Spirit within and thus be able to receive a vision from the Lord. </p>
    <p data-content-id="1obk6SP5zFDijUX2P01gtDB8H-13AkCwsUmjnnAsLvPvzIrlF3DycpamMxFy1mkml"> In this training we will mainly cover the sixty years of the Lord’s history among us, beginning with Brother Watchman Nee. Brother Nee was saved in the spring of 1920 and began to pursue the Lord that same year. By 1921 he had acquired much understanding and received significant revelations. He preached the gospel and testified for the Lord. The church life began in the spring of 1922. There was over half a year of preparation before the church life began. From October 1921 until October 1981 has been exactly sixty years. We are not here to narrate past events or to tell stories but to relate historical facts. Our burden is to see the preciousness of our revelation and to know its history. We will also consider the facts that show how history has confirmed this revelation. <mark data-id="1" style="background-color: rgba(228, 179, 72, 0.5); position: relative;" data-initialized="true">This study is a matter of extreme value.<div class="annotation-options hide" data-id="1" data-controls-for="annotation" style="top: -60px;"><div class="other-options-wrapper"><div class="highlight-colors other-options"><a href="#" data-name="copy-text" title="Copy Selected Text"><i class="fa-solid fa-copy fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div><div class="highlight-colors other-options"><a href="#" data-name="remove-highlight" title="Delete This Highlight"><i class="fas fa-trash-alt fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div><a class="close-button"><i class="fas fa-times-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div><div class="colors-wrapper"><div class="highlight-colors"><a href="#" title="yellow"><div class="yellow" data-p-slot="1" style="height: 28px; width: 28px;"></div></a></div><div class="highlight-colors"><a href="#" title="orange"><div class="orange" data-p-slot="2" style="height: 28px; width: 28px;"></div></a></div><div class="highlight-colors"><a href="#" title="green"><div class="green" data-p-slot="3" style="height: 28px; width: 28px;"></div></a></div><div class="highlight-colors"><a href="#" title="blue"><div class="blue" data-p-slot="4" style="height: 28px; width: 28px;"></div></a></div><div class="highlight-colors"><a href="#" title="pink"><div class="pink" data-p-slot="5" style="height: 28px; width: 28px;"></div></a></div><div class="highlight-colors"><a href="#" title="lavender"><div class="lavender" data-p-slot="6" style="height: 28px; width: 28px;"></div></a></div></div></div></mark> </p>
    <p data-content-id="9oaYXFidGK2OgPFlIsLPDatU5qj7AEDie-o4ovbmUrWjkAy7ku6JOTlw4y7HT486u"> After Brother Watchman Nee passed away in 1972, I was burdened to write his biography. I compiled thirty-two chapters of his biography three and a half years ago. This biography could have been published in the fall of 1978, but because of certain things <span id="6" data-page-id="6" class="pg">[6]</span> that transpired, I had a sense before the Lord to wait and reconsider. It is not easy to write a person’s biography. A good biography must be accurate, fair, and proper. On the one hand, it should not promote or exalt a person spiritually; on the other hand, it should provide spiritual value to God’s children so that they can receive help. For this reason I temporarily delayed the publishing of this biography. </p>
    <p data-content-id="jHsipl8JNe_0Ib8X-SyY57HJlCbxWcxbgeLT1O-4bUC9e-qpjbFPH73bw-8JhmEhO"> I also felt to write the history of the church. The two books of Chronicles in the Old Testament are a record of history from Adam to the time that the Chronicles were written. In the New Testament the four Gospels are biographies of the life of the Lord Jesus. Following the Gospels is the Acts of the Apostles, which is a history of the beginning of the Lord’s move on the earth through the church. The way in which Acts was written has afforded me a great deal of help, because it presents a principle. Acts was written in a beautiful and complete way. Some sinful things are recorded in Acts. For example, Ananias and Sapphira lied to and deceived the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287779" data-verses="Acts 5:1-11">5:1-11</span>); the saints in Jerusalem had all things in common, but they quarreled about the dispensing of food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287780" data-verses="Acts 2:44">2:44</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="287781" data-verses="Acts 6:1">6:1</span>); and Barnabas had a dispute with Paul concerning the way of the ministry, after which Barnabas is no longer mentioned (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287782" data-verses="Acts 15:35-39">15:35-39</span>). Acts also mentions many positive matters of value. However, it would be cumbersome for everything to be presented in Acts. We will follow this same principle in considering the history of the Lord’s recovery. We will look to the Lord’s leading and speak what He leads us to speak. </p>
    <p data-content-id="T7BuDLDXn0cZAqnuET7k8l950_9g_pCiuQAyHhgBli4yTXOSa8trvEIxit9yPQ7o7"> The brothers in the Far East and in America have repeatedly urged me to write our history. Most of Brother Nee’s contemporaries have passed away. The brothers feel that among the few who remain, I am the only one with a relatively thorough and complete knowledge of our history. I was absent during the first ten years of our history—from 1922 to July of 1932. However, for the past fifty years—from July of 1932 until today—I have not only been present; I have been in the center. I have not been personally involved with every matter, but in principle, because I have been fully aware of every matter, I can say that I have taken part in them. </p>
    <p data-content-id="xVmouT0WNz-QtrOUaFM3vi6CJUdgWZLmBXk3NbXwyrzaa6Y__7sDLaAKD7xoTmlXi"> In 1933, my second year in the church life, the Lord called me to leave my occupation and serve Him full time. From that time onward, Brother Nee gave me much perfecting. He was truly a pioneer in spiritual matters. At the time I did not realize that he was <span id="7" data-page-id="7" class="pg">[7]</span> perfecting me. Much time has passed since then, and many events have transpired. Regardless of what others may say concerning Brother Nee, in eternity I will not be able to deny the spiritual help that I received from him. I will be eternally grateful. I must also testify before heaven and earth, the angels, and all of you, that he had wisdom, and he also did his best to perfect me in the matters related to the first ten years of the recovery among us. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="ronsie_hPEaUbnxn0FFy54Eho8v3FRW0CB8lKWHwsEztSQPnlWQdRNoY4-vUjayXL" class="head1">INITIAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH BROTHER NEE</h2><p data-content-id="dEvJO-xhQn9YYskQwhXKFRw7d4Ujmq0uobSDruNWN6LVmy7ZpJK-OV2XdQaFAWIGL"> I was saved in the spring of 1925. I was in the North, in Shantung, and Brother Nee was in the South, in Fukien. His home was in Foochow, and my home was in Chefoo. At that time there was a British missionary whose husband came to China and opened a foreign firm to export Shantung products. This firm became a large export business called James McMullan, Ltd. The wife loved the Lord more than her husband did, and she became a self-supporting missionary. She operated a missionary church and published a monthly magazine in Chinese called <em>The Morning Star.</em> The level of spirituality in <em>The Morning Star</em> was not very high, but it contained the gospel and some spiritual matters. Brother Nee submitted a few articles to <em>The Morning Star.</em> </p>
    <p data-content-id="QYKxayJrX_KYmhUV1z2927B2kXVz3YJuDBCe9dlF3fmebdi84sBEZQYIyWwSaV0rY"> After I was saved, I loved the Lord and the Bible. Because I was determined to understand every verse in every chapter of the Bible, I purchased spiritual books and also subscribed to <em>The Morning Star.</em> To my impression the best articles that had the most supply in <em>The Morning Star</em> were by Brother Nee. After reading his articles, I thought that he must be a learned, experienced, and well-respected older man with a white beard. In 1925 Brother Nee began to publish <em>The Christian.</em> Because I loved the Bible, I corresponded with him. In one correspondence I wrote, “Mr. Nee, I sincerely want to understand the Bible. What is the best book to help me understand the Bible?” He replied, “The set of books that offers the most help in understanding the Bible is <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em> by John Nelson Darby.” He also said that a person needs to read this set of books four to five times because it is difficult to understand. I also asked him other questions regarding the Bible, and he answered all my questions. Thus, we began a general acquaintance through correspondence. </p>
    <p data-content-id="KxrSyn2MUddPTrHrrCFS86aAz6piSHQuEhlfcDeo0he0w-4I5ELvatAaWXgU2Q4s2"> In October of 1931 Brother Nee held the second overcomer <span id="8" data-page-id="8" class="pg">[8]</span> conference in Shanghai. I learned of the conference from his publications, applied to attend the conference, and was accepted. On the day I was to travel, I was waiting with my luggage to board the ship, when a telegram came. That day was September 18, and Japan had invaded the North Camp of Fengtian; the battle of “9.18” had begun. Many people urged me not to go to Shanghai, fearing that I would be unable to return home, so I returned home. Nevertheless, from that day Brother Nee and I corresponded more frequently. Even though I do not have the firsthand experience of being involved in the matters of the Lord’s recovery during those first ten years, I learned a considerable amount about Brother Nee and the Lord’s recovery through the books that he published. </p>
    <p data-content-id="ltgZjdp7ySldvAHnPY3nZ8hCLHJUIzG3djS5QLHszFuIKgYhU_E5Utqhvc70SscIc"> At the end of August in 1933 I left my occupation. I wanted to visit Brother Nee. In October I journeyed from Chefoo through Tientsin, Beijing, and Nanking to Shanghai. In Shanghai Brother Nee received me as his guest and as a trainee under his perfecting. The church in Shanghai was not very large, and there was not much work, so Brother Nee spent much time to labor on me. I stayed in Shanghai for four months. During this time I sought him out every week, and he fellowshipped with me for long periods of time. We never talked about vain and unprofitable worldly matters. Most of the time Brother Nee related church history to me, beginning from the first century. He spoke concerning the Reformation with Luther and also the rise of the British Brethren. </p>
