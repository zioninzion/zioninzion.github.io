THE SUBJECT</h2><h2 data-content-id="XG1qdH73elFV926fgt1LgeQj7h-kF7RWCy6xV3Z9_nsbzMNpiurcBpI2_EAY3W-AS" class="head2">A. Christ Replacing the Law<br>and Being versus Religion and Tradition</h2>
    <p data-content-id="kDasksB5vFMzwQXxkHSTrHD9accrX40wQxIkGROXFEF4lQ_mMoAwUNq30jKQU6T_T">The subject of the book of Galatians is related to its background. The subject is Christ replacing the law and being versus religion and tradition. In his introduction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487171" data-verses="Galatians 1:1-5">vv. 1-5</span>), Paul expresses his burden to rescue the distracted believers out of the evil religious age. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487172" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span> Paul says that Christ “gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father.” An age is a part of the world as the satanic system. An age refers to a section, an aspect, the present or modern appearance, of the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. We may regard each decade as a distinct age or section of Satan’s world system. <span id="7" data-page-id="7" class="pg"></span> </p>
    <p data-content-id="Jw-2Gf2mLlG_9SktQaieFf2WBHVPxLfqsZE2-EdZEFJ74DoreXntLhDSHOZINmBD-">The various ages of the satanic system are expressed in the fashions of clothing that prevail during a certain period of time. For example, in the 1950s men’s neckties were narrow, but in the late 1960s and throughout most of the 1970s, they were broad. Now, according to the latest change of style, they have become somewhat narrow again.</p>
    <p data-content-id="zAWRgSJEeshy3jNlKpCKh8CWk2hbU_aJNygwLNNTPO8qMW8SCbqNy_V6Uew8JqWP9">When I was young, I worked in a factory where hairnets were manufactured for export to the West. At first, the hairnets were large, designed to fit over hair styled in the shape of a tower. Then, to my surprise, we began to receive orders for small hairnets. The reason for the change was that women in the West were now wearing their hair very short, in a bobbed style, and therefore wanted small hairnets. By these illustrations of neckties and hairnets, we can see that the world system of Satan has different ages, different sections.</p>
    <p data-content-id="aeWQtqKFOYnBmO7EwnLKXrl7V9pEI17mnuL5wHRu7wY8AcOXol_FRANp_pzniJbTy"><em>The present evil age</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487173" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span>, according to the context of this book, refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion. This is confirmed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487174" data-verses="Galatians 6:14-15">6:14-15</span>, where circumcision is considered a part of the world—the religious world, which to the apostle Paul was crucified. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487175" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span> the apostle emphasized that the purpose of Christ’s giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us out, from the Jewish religion, the present evil age. This is to release God’s chosen people from the custody of the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487176" data-verses="Galatians 3:23">3:23</span>), to bring them out of the sheepfold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487177" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487178" data-verses="John 10:3">3</span>), according to the will of God. Thus, in his opening word, Paul indicated what he was going to deal with. He wanted to rescue the churches, which were distracted by Judaism with its law, and to bring them back to the grace of the gospel.</p>
    <p data-content-id="bPLRaSLqtjrhrwh4ZY_ZeoUyEApHitT8qsF4J5QwOg9QBF8HDIemOoElTjtCSpobD">For years I was fond of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487179" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">Galatians 1:4</span> and used this verse in messages. However, I did not realize that <em>the present evil age</em> in this verse refers to the Jewish religion. At the time of Paul, Judaism was very prevailing. His intention in writing to the Galatians was to rescue the distracted believers from the tyranny of the present evil religious age.</p>
    <p data-content-id="qPmcHvDy4nljKijbAKoXWCikA-xluNidIJTXU0MWMKaz_nCGWRqqdmsrV53jcTq3Z">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487180" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span> Paul points out that in order to rescue us from the present evil religious age, Christ gave Himself for our sins. This indicates that Christ died in order to rescue us from Judaism. <span id="8" data-page-id="8" class="pg"></span> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487181" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> we see that Christ as the good Shepherd entered into the fold in order to bring His sheep out of the fold and into the pasture. The fold in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487182" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> signifies the law or Judaism as the religion of the law, in which God’s chosen people were kept and guarded in custody or ward until Christ came. Before the coming of Christ, God used Judaism as a fold to keep His sheep. But Christ has come as the Shepherd to bring the sheep out of that fold to the pasture where they may feed on His riches. Although Christ came to release the sheep from the fold, the Judaizers crucified this good Shepherd. He died on the cross not only for the sins of the sheep but also to bring them out of the fold.</p>
