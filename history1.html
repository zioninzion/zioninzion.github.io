    <h2 data-content-id="JPqITnrszRhXX3IIJMNg6At_DXeB3uqKpWwef3OUZtNXnE6A280Fdvm2rPkLCiMmP" class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE LORD’S RECOVERY</h2><p data-content-id="zNNllKtFRXbZ5F6IH3GU566aOBCqtGSQinhQeBUvcyf_HN2w--munuNeXFh39wPUi"> We will begin with the first century, because the Lord’s recovery <span id="9" data-page-id="9" class="pg"></span> did not begin sixty years ago. The Lord’s recovery began around the end of the first century, when the church became desolate, and it has not been interrupted since then. </p>
    <p data-content-id="a3vCx4i8WlLz_PiJSBR2S_cFxCd6i6ntmH_KEkH1bQlzfNYWBUM8TWOQgDKj_BKED"> The divine revelation, which is the Bible, was completed at the end of the first century. The first person to write the Scriptures was Moses. He wrote the first five books of the Bible approximately one thousand five hundred years before the birth of the Lord Jesus, that is, approximately three thousand five hundred years ago. After Moses other people who lived in different places and at different times continued to write the Holy Scriptures. Approximately four hundred years before the birth of the Lord Jesus, some Jewish scribes collected the Pentateuch, the five books of Moses, and the other spiritual scrolls that were written by men who were inspired by God. After this material was examined, thirty-nine books were recognized as God’s holy Word. These are the books of the Old Testament. </p>
    <p data-content-id="bcZGtdWhgZOZ-Y1BV89MTJBP64rBWnBHKHFLQPHWa-43Jm0QB8fEviuvPqU6tFQnj"> The last book of the Old Testament is Malachi. From the writing of Malachi until the birth of the Lord Jesus, a period of approximately four hundred years, no more divine words were written. Approximately two thousand years ago, the Lord Jesus was born, lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, died, was buried, resurrected, and ascended; the Holy Spirit descended; and the church was produced. After this, people began to write the New Testament. Initially, there were many Gospels, but when they were examined and appraised, only the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were recognized. </p>
    <p data-content-id="qQaAD7XiouqLp6NcUfBf7e60DQ4l4WImBTrXfwMT_P8In694X6bI_LkdK0AUUOLcA"> The Gospels are followed by the Acts of the Apostles, which was written by Luke. After Acts are the Epistles of Paul, which are a total of fourteen books, from Romans to Hebrews. The Epistles of Paul were written neither too early nor too late. Paul began writing from approximately <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 54 and finished in approximately <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 67. Following Paul’s Epistles are the Epistle of James, the Epistles of Peter, the Epistles of John, the Epistle of Jude, and the book of Revelation, which was written by John. These complete the writing of the New Testament. </p>
    <p data-content-id="yvk6HuMr8NgKovSLAlIbjjPVD6W8ccI-fVU1RmyX9ImUIz44kI4RinDco5-pK15fw"> However, the New Testament was not examined and appraised in the first century; it was only confirmed when it was gradually recognized by churches in every place after the first century. At the end of the first century, seven books—Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation—had not been recognized. It <span id="10" data-page-id="10" class="pg"></span> was not until <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 397, when Christian teachers gathered for a council in Carthage of northern Africa, that these seven books were recognized as part of the New Testament, and it was concluded that the New Testament has twenty-seven books. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="8586EAxGNMxjCFvPw26Y0F6x_VLL_L8dGb1RINqEEpPx5v-eANCkxDrrJB8Kb6J6e" class="head1">THE COMPLETING MINISTRY OF PAUL</h2><p data-content-id="0fVqXFbdBpkkqCC0WGRrb38UeX3OyQ5vQQEGWaCVPpvjv2ewbr_rY5SKfA_y47WbK"> At the end of the first century, even though the New Testament was not yet entirely recognized, God’s revelation was complete. The central books of the New Testament are Paul’s Epistles. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="287783" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">Colossians 1:25</span> Paul says that his ministry was to complete the word of God. This means that what Paul wrote completed the word of God. The emphasis in this completing word is Christ. </p>
    <p data-content-id="78M5qRlQxSdk3cdiDrcw-RbPS0ejp8SJCAqrRPpWQS2ajdqkf_Nr-FWIKw_xd0T5L"> Paul emphasized two points concerning Christ: the Spirit and life. Although the other books of the New Testament also mention the Spirit, they do not speak of the Spirit as much as Paul does in his Epistles. Paul actually speaks of two spirits. On one hand, he speaks of the Spirit of God, that is, the Spirit of Christ, the life-giving Spirit. He often uses the simple term <em>the Spirit</em> in reference to this Spirit. In the Chinese Union Version <em>the Spirit</em> is usually translated as “the Holy Spirit” with three dots added to the word <em>Holy,</em> indicating that the word <em>Holy</em> is not in the original text. In the original Greek text Paul emphatically uses the definite article <em>the</em> to describe the Spirit of God, which is also the Spirit of Christ. Paul calls this Spirit “the Spirit.” </p>
    <p data-content-id="_2ImBFFRntdiH8OGMJDf8Np5wcPD8sAyyp3Uf2QSrUlW534-ZKxlACUERtRbKP7EW"> On the other hand, Paul’s Epistles speak of the spirit of man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="287784" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:11">1 Corinthians 2:11</span> Paul says, “Who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?” The things of man are not outward necessities, such as housing, transportation, beautiful clothes, good food, education, or money. Such things do not require the spirit of man in order to know them; man’s mind is able to know them. Hence, these are not the things of man. What are the things of man? Whatever is related to man’s origin, his real condition, his spirit, his soul, his body, his being condemned before God, where he is going, and his destiny are the things of man. In other words, man needs to receive God and enjoy Christ. He also needs to be forgiven, justified, reconciled to God, and regenerated. These and other related matters are the things of man. Paul says that only the spirit of man can know the things of man. </p>
    <p data-content-id="BfEGB8Ng0Wvl4DskaOdHYWRAKAI6I_d88YGSOGs6_lcGTL2Zf6g3K_QFuPsYfJumS"> In the second half of the same verse Paul also says that only the <span id="11" data-page-id="11" class="pg"></span> Spirit of God can know the things of God. What are the things of God? The things of God are that God, in the Spirit and through His Son Jesus Christ, wants to dispense Himself into man, that is, into man’s spirit. This is not as shallow as God’s creating the heavens and the earth; it is the depths of God. Thus, it can be known only by having the Spirit of God. In 1 Corinthians Paul speaks of man’s being redeemed, sanctified, and justified. Our human spirit is needed in order to understand these matters. Paul also says that God has given Christ to us for our glorification. Such things cannot come up in man’s imagination, for they are known only through the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God. Therefore, Paul’s Epistles emphatically mention the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. </p>
    <p data-content-id="xThQOhsRpZcWf7p_o41UvBQCDZ2S9fLB_rKLTdnQLzjJrM25FKuJuJLnfNI_o5_cS"> In his Epistles Paul also speaks of Christ being life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287785" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">Col. 3:4</span>) and of the Spirit being the Spirit of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287786" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>). What Paul says concerning life is more profound and practical than what any other writer of the New Testament says. For example, the Gospel of John says that the Lord is life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287787" data-verses="John 11:25">11:25</span>), but Paul goes one step further and speaks of “Christ our life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287788" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">Col. 3:4</span>). Paul’s speaking is deep and intimate. Finally, Paul also speaks concerning the church and, hence, speaks concerning Christ’s death and resurrection in a deep and rich way. The church was produced by Christ, but it was produced through Christ’s death and resurrection. If Christ had not died and resurrected, the church could not have been produced. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="287789" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> Paul uses Adam and Eve as an illustration of the church being produced through Christ’s death and resurrection. </p>
    <p data-content-id="rH2Q06ASyQ6-MH4ccpJnobG71ogca8Xt2hfM_dbpGJZl2rFfSubQaEZAdt-1gIijm"> Paul’s Epistles speak of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church, and also of Christ’s death and resurrection. We mainly understand Christ’s death and resurrection as a personal matter, but what Paul says concerning Christ’s death and resurrection emphasizes a corporate matter, the church. Hence, the completion of God’s word does not concern doctrines, the creation of heaven and earth, or the history of mankind. Rather, the completion of God’s word concerns Christ, through death and resurrection, becoming the life-giving Spirit to be our life and to produce the church. The church is the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287790" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Eph. 1:22-23</span>), the new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287791" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="287792" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span>), the fullness of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287793" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">1:23</span>), the dwelling place of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287794" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">2:22</span>), and the beloved of Christ, that is, the bride of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287795" data-verses="Ephesians 5:22-33">5:22-33</span>). This is what Paul reveals. This is God’s revelation. </p>
    <p data-content-id="dnhNpwwCrsx0qLJsXW_tJK95OafVqlxnHVv9b2dibm9QOM-wG-zn9qdrWkTvMwVUA"> We cannot say that God’s revelation does not include His creation <span id="12" data-page-id="12" class="pg"></span> of the heavens and the earth. We cannot say that God’s revelation does not include man’s fall, becoming sinful, and deserving to perish. Furthermore, we cannot say that God’s revelation does not include the birth of Christ. It depends on how man understands these matters. To understand the birth of Christ as Christmas is not only too shallow but also distorted. But if we understand the birth of Christ as the Triune God entering into humanity, being joined to man as one, then this is a deep mystery. </p>
    <p data-content-id="QntV8KqUiuC9AdU2_go4DYo2f9LheLtZN7A0HY1jkNrDXV8T6kVmKkFTIk9jPZsbf"> According to Paul’s Epistles, Christ is God. He is the embodiment of the Triune God, the bodily expression of the Triune God. After Christ went through the four steps of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. In resurrection and in the position of ascension, He entered into man to be man’s life. This is Paul’s revelation. I hope that we would not be influenced by traditional Christianity or have the view of Christianity concerning Christ’s birth, death, and resurrection but that we would see the kernel of the Bible. </p>
    <p data-content-id="KeZnFzRHwqS5R1XPrhdsbIFJEyDLX9x9-_kL5FapBkVSAlrhRoc72TrIcB9GMvbL3"> Christ went through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="287796" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> says, “The Spirit was not yet.” Why was the Spirit not yet? The Spirit was not yet because the procedure was not complete; that is, the Lord Jesus at that time had not yet been glorified. When was the Lord glorified? He was glorified when He was resurrected (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287797" data-verses="Luke 24:26">Luke 24:26</span>). When He was resurrected and glorified, His process of becoming the Spirit was completed. This process began from the manger in Bethlehem and was completed when Christ was resurrected. The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God. </p>
    <p data-content-id="lpzEm1z_N3y10s47txSAKMWli2nuWjPHOevoJ24He4bCQKb3DJldRSHH13IT5r6_R"> Our Savior is our Redeemer and is also our God and our Lord. He is the embodiment of life and the aggregate of life. He became the Spirit of life and entered into our spirit to enliven our spirit and to regenerate us. God has joined us—those who are regenerated and have His Spirit within—to Christ, and He has joined us to one another. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="287798" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:21">2 Corinthians 1:21</span> the apostle Paul says, “The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.” The apostle and the believers are joined together, and they are joined to God’s anointed One, Christ. This is the unique true vine in the universe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287799" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15:1</span>). </p>
    <p data-content-id="Ob1XxueNYrJfjnt0HQ_3JyK0i40MoHiY98Hs1tuaw5DQgtLawdrq7jq0kSR56mezY"> A vine tree has many branches, and the many branches are joined as one in the vine. In the same manner, you have the Spirit of life <span id="13" data-page-id="13" class="pg"></span> inside you, and I have the Spirit of life inside me. This Spirit of life has not only joined you to Christ and joined me to Christ, but He has also joined us corporately to Christ. Therefore, the branches and the vine have one life and one living and are in the one life flow. This is the Body of Christ. This Body is the fullness of Christ, the expression of Christ. This Body is also the new man, the dwelling place of God, and the bride whom Christ loves. This is the revelation of the Bible. </p>
