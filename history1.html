This dispute concerned how Christ could be both God and man. Some said that Christ was not God; others said that Christ did not come in the flesh and was not a man. Therefore, John wrote his Gospel to refute the heresy of Christ not being God. At the beginning of his Gospel, John says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287806" data-verses="John 1:1">1:1</span>). This meticulously shows that Jesus is God. John also wrote his first Epistle to refute the heresy that Christ did not come in the flesh. In <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 325 the Roman emperor Constantine the Great gathered all the Christian teachers who were involved in the dispute regarding the person of Christ to a council in Nicaea. Constantine the Great was the chairman of the council and used his authority to institute the Nicene Creed. Even until today Catholicism and Protestantism firmly hold the Nicene Creed and esteem it as the basic creed of the faith. </p>
    <p data-content-id="EAvOmg_sWjPgt1hDOUHsNYNUvEZCJDaeWIFjWgQjQHXMYZWpjFjuj7P4434vsAguI"> In 1970 we released some messages that were later published in a book entitled <em>Concerning the Person of Christ</em>. This book lists seven different schools of thought concerning the person of Christ in the first six centuries. The first school taught that Christ has divinity but not humanity; that is, He is God but not a man. The second school taught that Christ has only humanity but not divinity; that is, He is only a man but not God. The third school taught that Christ has divinity but that His divinity is incomplete. The fourth school taught that Christ has humanity but that His humanity is incomplete; that is, He has a human body and a human soul but not a human spirit. The fifth school taught that Christ’s divinity and humanity are distinct and separate because one person cannot possess two natures. If there are two natures, there must be two persons. The sixth school taught that Christ’s divinity and humanity were merged to produce a third nature. The seventh school is orthodox, correct, and scriptural. This school taught that Christ has both divinity and humanity and that both natures are complete and mingled but do not produce a third nature. This means that Christ is the true God and also a real man. He is God and man, man and God. Although He has both the divine nature and the human nature, He is still one person. This is the revelation of the Bible. <span id="15" data-page-id="15" class="pg"></span> </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="D9KUdi_no0eRPkcjlvhx9JmYce7_tnIt4aqXfXwv-EY1cUihvg2Krd4iCqUQot_i2" class="head1">THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH<br>AND THE DARK AGES IN THE MIDDLE AGES</h2><p data-content-id="SWyxoso-wsZbMNWh1AYeh7ocRgzftzgzkfAWjmC6iG4b3X10VFFVRr-Mzb4DNsvi6"> When Constantine the Great used his imperial authority to hold the Council of Nicaea and institute the Nicene Creed, the church was joined to a political power. This was the beginning of the formation of Roman Catholicism. In the fifth century the bishop of Rome, Leo I, considered himself as the highest authority of the church and became the first pope. By the sixth century the papal system was established, and it unified the churches in the West. Thus, the Roman Catholic Church was formally established, and the degradation of the church reached its climax. The Roman Catholic Church flourished for ten centuries, from the sixth century to the fifteenth or sixteenth century. However, Roman Catholicism forbid the common believers to read the Bible. As a result, for ten centuries there was no light, and the whole world fell into spiritual darkness. In history this period is called the Dark Ages during the Middle Ages. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="gMRP6oLRCKOOeXy92nE8xWUQ6FHGCR2TBckzIb4y4UE5BMJvOJytKzoRfjKtTAGf6" class="head1">LUTHER AND THE REFORMATION</h2><p data-content-id="es0cmqmo2bSRPlzoYg6jE-vfJImtSuAECQ4Od9WJqQLWGBgHi3ihQKAdbCEaWCGO-"> The Reformation began in the fifteenth to sixteenth centuries. Martin Luther was the strongest person in the Reformation. However, before Luther, in the 1300s John Wycliffe and his follower, John Huss, did some work of reformation. John Wycliffe translated the Old Testament and the New Testament into English for the common people to read. Furthermore, he strongly advocated the Bible being open to the public, because he firmly believed that the Bible is the unique standard of the faith. Because John Huss promoted this teaching, he was sentenced to death as a martyr. </p>
    <p data-content-id="5e00GL6X4KTLTe6gGn6_rcLgRbPwvxTnt8Wxmh9g7zm_I0P0LlYgm9FG101PxmZf7"> After John Huss was martyred, Martin Luther continued the line of recovery. Luther recovered justification by faith, and he used the Bible as the basis of all the truths. As a result of Luther’s reforming work, common believers no longer wanted to remain in the Roman Catholic Church. Hence, the Roman Catholic Church conspired to murder him. The German nobles did not agree with the views of the Roman Catholic Church and therefore gave Luther special protection so that his life was preserved. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="NUpkgYfUZdfz2S8sOLj4aZRyb3SAeArJ8LUXE3_WhzSOwWU7WzzNj-NP1gGLM_dUS" class="head1">THE STATE CHURCHES</h2><p data-content-id="tI7Ub_4jfQam8vOe1uM66RLuYHKt0qH8U5z_LHubh2OKfUndz-uSvO6o-z_ds5nHF"> Germany began the establishment of the state church. Luther knew that the state church was wrong, but he was weak in this matter <span id="16" data-page-id="16" class="pg"></span> because he needed the protection of Germany. After this, England, Denmark, and Sweden followed in succession and established state churches. A state church takes the king or emperor as its head. For example, the emperor of Germany is the head of the German state church. As long as a person is a German, he is a member of the German state church. Every German citizen must pay the church tax. Hence, besides the Roman Catholic Church, there are also the so-called state churches. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="hcp9m1FuBp-Zy6-jymgYnfjCRwAKU-SxMh2VrxrTa_KZYzAts5GsA_kBU_g3yadT1" class="head1">THE DENOMINATIONS</h2><p data-content-id="U8D6BQZotIxg1IgGVeQTDzORZXBApldezGducnG4qu5SbwZRN_eCT_HJWZRQgbaA6"> At this juncture the Lord raised up a group of people who loved the truth. These believers found many truths in the Bible and were willing to rise up to practice these truths. They refused to be dominated by the Roman Catholic Church or controlled by a state church. Thus, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries many free groups formed so-called independent churches or private churches, such as the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Methodist Church. These groups are different denominations today. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="MChS44jzGMa4wRjXH-mu8h2LZNeoVxO4pq0LdHaEiUl-KD8IGPvPO0OZfb-lHo1zt" class="head1">OBJECTIVE DOCTRINAL SCHOOLS<br>AND SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENTIAL SCHOOLS</h2><p data-content-id="V7aDZxBlTqThMzqEGUHc_rEE6higcErVaUPL_odu94ddR1SS-KSIBH78AGF5Kxj3Q"> Beginning in the first century, the church gradually degraded and left the truth. By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries three major organizations were produced—the Roman Catholic Church, various state churches, and privately established independent churches. However, in every century there has been a minority of people who loved the Lord out of a pure heart and who also loved the truth. These believers practiced the truths that they saw in the Bible. Their understanding of Christ was correct, and they focused on the Holy Spirit more than on the letter and doctrine. These believers focused on life and also on letting people meet together and worship God freely according to the scriptural way. </p>
    <p data-content-id="ien0waqxaF4oFwsBQquNZnNNHeKmGjhQXVoGXCNBvqK7XqH8Rl6GZS6YY6ZqgP0IJ"> For example, at the time of the Reformation with Luther, there was a contemporary of Luther named Kaspar Schwenckfeld who had a better understanding of the Spirit and of life than Luther. A large part of what Luther recovered was objective truth; he lacked subjective experience. In contrast, Schwenckfeld saw that salvation is not a doctrine but an experience that depends on the exercise <span id="17" data-page-id="17" class="pg"></span> of one’s faith. What does a person believe? He believes that Jesus Christ, the God-man, was crucified, resurrected, and glorified to be the life-giving Spirit. Schwenckfeld said that the Word of God is the life-giving Spirit and that this Word became flesh, Jesus Christ. Schwenckfeld said that the experience of salvation must be a spiritual reality and that this reality must be a direct relationship produced through the spirit of man and the Spirit of God. This relationship produces an organism to exhibit the divine, heavenly life. Schwenckfeld also said that the glorified nature of the glorified Christ has become food for our human spirit so that we may enjoy this God-man by eating Him and drinking Him. These revelations nearly match what we have seen. </p>
    <p data-content-id="14CNNJ9eRuzbAFhrK1-JnJOo_FZxhrDlm2JwlF4ouRa1oKlcwZeN86DPwyj8b8Puf"> Luther would not accept Schwenckfeld and even asked him to leave the city, because Luther did not want to be in the same place with Schwenckfeld. There were two main schools in the Reformation: the Lutherans and the Schwenckfeldians. There was the objective doctrinal school and the subjective experiential school. That which is objective is an outward truth, but that which is subjective is a deep mystery. Of which school are we today? Are we of the objective school or of the subjective school? We are both objective and subjective; hence, we are both. </p>

Therefore, when the apostles were alive, there was no great person who controlled others. Paul established elders in each locality by following the leading of the Holy Spirit, but elders were not great persons lording over the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287808" data-verses="1Peter 5:1-3">1 Pet. 5:1-3</span>). The word <em>elders</em> refers to believers who are more mature in life. The elders are more experienced, have more insight, and are relatively more judicious. They need not be elderly. Paul also called them overseers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287809" data-verses="Acts 20:28">Acts 20:28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="287810" data-verses="1Timothy 3:1-2">1 Tim. 3:1-2</span>). The word <em>overseer</em> in the original language refers to a person who supervises matters from above. An elder denotes a person who is relatively more mature, but an overseer denotes the function of the elders, what the elders do. Both <em>elders</em> and <em>overseers</em> refer to the same persons. </p>
    <p data-content-id="TZPjD3eaAEvknfaoPr30YtfQ2DvSS09fMu2kgW8C-OhkhHfvdQbjm-9xclyF_2L1h"> Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="287811" data-verses="Acts 20:1">Acts 20</span> clearly indicates that the overseers of the church in Ephesus were the elders of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="287812" data-verses="Acts 20:17">vv. 17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="287813" data-verses="Acts 20:28">28</span>). In the <span id="18" data-page-id="18" class="pg"></span> second century, after the apostles had passed away, a Bible teacher whose name was Ignatius rose up. He loved the Lord and was eventually martyred for the Lord. However, in his writings he made the great mistake of separating the overseers and the elders into two groups of people. He also gave the overseers special authority. He wrote that the elders were for one place and that churches in several places should be grouped together into a diocese under the management of an overseer. Thus, an overseer became above the elders. This one mistake later produced a hierarchy. Based on this teaching, overseers were above the elders, bishops were above the overseers, archbishops were above the bishops, the cardinals of Rome were above the archbishops, and the pope was chosen from among the cardinals. These levels of overseers are called the clergy. Throughout history those who love the Lord from a pure heart have rejected the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church. Eventually, however, the state churches also developed the clerical system, and the so-called independent churches developed the pastoral system. All of these are mediatorial classes. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="ncOAZQUsBQTDzVA6wlRcAXIHyvpiFEW4Qt-PcuKAUs7IKn1OhM8zDw54YNMNzHMNN" class="head1">THE MORAVIAN BRETHREN</h2><p data-content-id="6pOSsROSZcsSLSaM_do4O0YZyzpzvu4ztMs8IVbcjVgznsj4PjZDMw_O4npH3AKVU"> By the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries various free groups had emerged. Most of these groups called themselves brethren. These believers did not want the organization of the clergy, and their members called each other brothers. As a result, they faced opposition and persecution from the Catholic Church and from the state churches. The brethren who were scattered in Bohemia and Moravia escaped to Germany for refuge. In the eighteenth century there was a believer named Zinzendorf in Saxony of Germany. Zinzendorf was a count, owned a large estate, and was very rich. Because he loved the Lord, Zinzendorf welcomed the persecuted brethren to his estate and gathered them together to serve God freely. Since most of the believers who took refuge came from Moravia, people called them the Moravian Brethren. </p>
    <p data-content-id="RZlPxLfziMHc9UDCBnLtc7PnE6QbLw0vBcRXGaTy7sEkGCmz5zs9o6JVED5YHHUof"> When people heard that Zinzendorf’s estate was a place of refuge for the persecuted, various believers who were persecuted for their faith sought refuge at his estate. Besides the brethren from Moravia, believers from independent groups went there as well. Because these believers came from different places, they had different views toward various doctrines. Through much prayer with tears and by relying <span id="19" data-page-id="19" class="pg"></span> on the Lord’s love and wisdom, Zinzendorf encouraged the believers who sought refuge at his estate to drop their different opinions, to recover the past teachings of the church, to love one another, and to remain in oneness. Even though the condition of their meetings cannot be considered as a complete recovery of the church life, they had at least seventy percent of the church life. About two hundred years after Luther’s Reformation, the church life finally began. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="s0IM7um95aIDSEQmkz8SiZ6iB7UzFFOw2MHw1MC2Hge-X5ym_8ndik756xygk_O9v" class="head1">THE BRITISH BRETHREN</h2><p data-content-id="wyEUpIjwSXJsd3rz3tPe0UI6RY79uCduVqUUV_xXqEBAcUqt_73dH_FG3FxIS5325"> After another century, in the 1800s God again raised up a group of brethren in England, among whom J. N. Darby was a leading one. The light that these believers saw exceeded what Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren saw. Brother Nee once said that the rise of the British Brethren can be considered as the fulfillment of the church in Philadelphia in the seven epistles in the book of Revelation. This proves that the initial condition of the Brethren was a full recovery of the church life. They had a rich understanding of the truth and a good spiritual condition. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="LZrYPLdTOsOOl1yiE5KRtNK6NJiNRseI6G1kRV9PvMmWAgV9exmtPtPJtWwirAeLF" class="head1">THE DIVISION OF THE BRETHREN</h2><p data-content-id="mbyps54m2PchesLsYPdZW8rFty_pVHU2t6gG22-tnVerTV__0f931Akp2vScFCgAl"> Martin Luther’s Reformation released the locked-up Bible, but he did not interpret the Bible. The people who read the Bible found it difficult to understand. Only when the Brethren were raised up was the Bible interpreted. They interpreted most of the prophecies and types. Regrettably, their own unprecedented understanding of the Bible issued in their paying too much attention to doctrine, which resulted in arguments. The fiercest contention among them was regarding the rapture of the saints. Darby said that the saints will be raptured before the great tribulation, but his co-worker Benjamin Newton, who was also a leading brother, said that the saints will be raptured after the great tribulation. These two also had different views regarding the person of Christ. Thus, Darby and Newton were divided. As a result, Newton was excommunicated. After Newton’s excommunication the doctrinal disputes increased daily. After ninety years, at the end of the First World War, the Brethren were divided into over one hundred fifty assemblies. Today there are over one thousand Brethren assemblies. They have divided again and again. <span id="20" data-page-id="20" class="pg"></span> </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="ZmwMsa-cINJTGUaNWYSRA382yDpKPcBTE0m1E2pybKoOTXEJiOhP5-k11_p_USDKQ" class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE LORD’S RECOVERY IN CHINA</h2><p data-content-id="Aoj6LJyg-I5wHlc_OGukP19sIlRXbC9EaPkQF_RJnYvz79CPS-Eh3ZqXTgnLU-2l3"> In 1920, one hundred years after the British Brethren were raised up, the Lord was forced to come to the Gentile land of China because He had no way in the confused situation in Europe and America. What Brother Nee said to me concerning this made a deep impression on me. He said, “By the time the Lord raised us up, the Western world was spoiled as far as the proper church life was concerned. In both Europe and America, the Catholic Church, the state churches, and the private churches have caused much confusion. After the Brethren emerged, they declared that there is only one Body of Christ, that there is also only one church, and that there should not be divisions, but they eventually divided more than any other group. Therefore, in Europe and in America there is only confused Christianity. The Lord was forced to go to China, a virgin soil.” Brother Nee said that even though China was a Gentile land that did not have many believers, it was not complicated in relation to the church. Hence, the Lord could begin His recovery in China. Thus, the Lord came to China. </p>
