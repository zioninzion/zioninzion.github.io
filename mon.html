In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496524" data-verses="1Timothy 2:1">2:1</span> he goes on to say, “I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men.” If we would have a proper church life, we must first have a prayer life. The leading ones, those who minister the word in the church, should take the lead to have such a prayer life. A prayer ministry is the prerequisite for the administration and shepherding of a local church. Thus, Paul exhorts Timothy that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men. This is the first word concerning the positive aspect of the church life that Paul gives after speaking of God’s economy and after charging Timothy to war the good warfare for God’s economy. Timothy had to take the lead to have a prayer life.</p>

    <p data-content-id="9urkfFSdDLQj4fWJVl67Bd9gDtnrAGGnZvtB1i5He5j-pAy7ku6JOTlw4y7HT486u">…[I]n reading the Bible, we need to touch the spirit of the writer. The Bible in black and white letters can be likened to a human body, and the writer’s spirit can be likened to the life, or to the spirit, in the body. Within the “body” of the Bible, there is the writer’s spirit. If we touch Paul’s spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496525" data-verses="1Timothy 2:1-7">1 Timothy 2:1-7</span>, we will sense his burden that those who take the lead in the church life must have a prayer life. In these verses Paul seems to be telling Timothy, “I have shown you a clear picture of God’s economy and how it is versus different teachings. I have also pointed out to you that, in His mercy, the Lord has made me a pattern of His economy. I have also charged you solemnly to war the good warfare on behalf of God’s economy. Now deep in my spirit is the burden to exhort you to pray. I exhort that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men. Do not think that teaching comes before prayer. No, prayer must be first, and teaching, second.”</p>
    <p data-content-id="jBdehlMJIfZZQLv7jbDs78X9fFfhWe0enPOqvDcZRG3gc-qpjbFPH73bw-8JhmEhO">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496526" data-verses="1Timothy 2:1">2:1</span> Paul mentions petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings. Prayer is general, having worship and fellowship as its essence. Petitions are special and are for particular needs. The Greek word rendered “intercessions” denotes an approaching of God in a personal and confiding manner, that is, an intervening, an interfering, before God in others’ affairs <span id="28" data-page-id="28" class="pg"></span> for their benefit. In addition, we must offer thanksgiving. Often when we hear good news about certain churches, elders, or saints, we praise them instead of giving thanks to God for them. If the situation in a certain church is good, it is because of God, not because of the church. Likewise, if a particular elder or saint is doing well, it also is because of God’s grace. Therefore, instead of praising a church or a person, we should give thanks to God.</p>
    <p data-content-id="T9wSLLzXi160Y60CZaKQ-itNO45w_rHnpBFLcsCgvwNvQXOSa8trvEIxit9yPQ7o7">In mentioning petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings, Paul’s spirit was very burdened concerning the importance of prayer. He wanted his dear spiritual children to pray. Again and again I would emphasize the fact that we can have a proper church life only if we have a prayer life…</p>
    <h2 data-content-id="wcJgTAG5qtRZcGNZu0r5_VeXSfPfObP-iYaKM-gBQKiBjG0wVg9EEOsaWVDbmQlt3" class="head1">GOD’S DESIRE</h2><p data-content-id="LiPk6JQKFFbC04hKBfimYKm-qqfucmSmeLJWY1-Da1Od86aHaofflJiWKbPxeJBoB">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496529" data-verses="1Timothy 2:4">verse 4</span> Paul says that God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth. We should pray on behalf of all men because God our Savior desires all men to be saved and to know the truth. Our prayer is required for the carrying out of God’s desire.</p>
    <p data-content-id="mC_un-mV_NmeofcPCEsesoJA7ImZKU_UnUdkJeY4BzRtHgRmOmzGSBshLSiOE25xk">God desires all the saved ones to have the full knowledge of the truth. <em>Truth</em> means “reality,” denoting all the real things revealed in God’s Word, which are mainly Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the Body of Christ. Every saved person should have a full knowledge, a complete realization, of these things.</p>
    <p data-content-id="ZRKcRSs3LsvV5dkFHnmiXQBf8xVBOs_UFswy4InbPvJJP0lBffpBB7cCXexrmTw8R">The object of the two Epistles to Timothy is to deal with the church’s decline. In the first Epistle the decline crept in subtly through different teachings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496530" data-verses="1Timothy 1:3">1:3</span>), and in the second it had developed openly and was worsening through heresies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496531" data-verses="2Timothy 2:16-18">2:16-18</span>). To deal with such a decline, the truth must be maintained. The first Epistle emphasizes that God desires all His saved ones to have the full knowledge of the truth and that the church is the pillar and base of the truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496532" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">3:15</span>). The second Epistle stresses that the word of the truth should be rightly unfolded (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496533" data-verses="2Timothy 2:15">2:15</span>) and that the ones who have deviated should return to the truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496534" data-verses="2Timothy 2:25">v. 25</span>).</p>
    <h2 data-content-id="AvTK_1Mi4P0sj7uPbdOzJ2Ejy6X4wF6CHXt31s8xWhTWxqzoXk8OAay-baTdy_efZ" class="head1">ONE MEDIATOR</h2><p data-content-id="FF0LJ7lCW7C4RYOemJXkMPzyfB87jP2mCiryfwxZwFm6BquFbyY_EaYhwW0pZR8Hh">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496535" data-verses="1Timothy 2:5">1 Timothy 2:5</span> Paul continues, “For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” In this verse Paul explicitly says that there is one God. Although God is triune—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—He is still the <span id="30" data-page-id="30" class="pg"></span> one God, not three Gods, contrary to what is mistakenly recognized and believed by many Christians.</p>
    <p data-content-id="CGmFwUvt2cj4rEbWjDdOvkiG_0_rYhGtusgGORLLDXQw7Xk2cPamyVlIGivgjaMtV">In this verse Paul also tells us that there is one Mediator of God and men. A mediator is a go-between. The one Mediator is the man Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus was God from eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496536" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>). In time He became a man through incarnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496537" data-verses="John 1:14">v. 14</span>). While He was living on earth as a man, He was also God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496538" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Tim. 3:16</span>). After His resurrection He is still man, as well as God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496539" data-verses="Acts 7:56">Acts 7:56</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496540" data-verses="John 20:28">John 20:28</span>). Hence, He is the only One qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men.</p>
    <h2 data-content-id="Pcdzu-zGQHuXaqaffgoYajjTFJJF-E_RfrL_fzT4-0BqBFpAH_L-ztA29wWp8YYIb" class="head1">THE TESTIMONY BORNE IN ITS OWN TIMES</h2><p data-content-id="-dvxRIITa5QjtnmRTKnfqyNqWdtFVI545xlyafqSIziqI7eT5AaDL7s8amgQ5vfjW"><span class="verse" data-ref-id="496541" data-verses="1Timothy 2:6">First Timothy 2:6</span> says, “Who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony to be borne in its own times.” Christ gave Himself for the accomplishing of redemption for all men. This was necessary in order that He might be our Mediator. The Greek word for <em>ransom</em> means “ransom paid in recompense.” He is qualified to be the Mediator of God and men, not only in His divine and human person but also in His redemptive work. Both His person and His work are unique.</p>
    <p data-content-id="pB7TP4XoYsur8jo8CPjqpJKQ7Ocr2OOMCklQqRVAxxr9utC3cgQPugIj-GPE_ryq2">In this verse Paul speaks of “the testimony to be borne in its own times.” The fact that Christ gave Himself as a ransom for all men becomes the testimony to be borne in its own times. Whenever this fact is proclaimed, it is borne to men as a testimony in its own times. For example, when this fact was preached in Africa, that automatically became a testimony borne to men in Africa in its own times. The preaching of the fact is always spontaneously a testimony of the fact. When Paul preached in Asia Minor, that was the testimony borne in its own times. The same was true when he received the Macedonian call and began to preach in eastern Europe. That was the proper time for the testimony to be declared there. Whenever the facts of Christ’s incarnation and death on behalf of all are proclaimed, that is the preaching, the testimony, borne in its own times.</p>

This means that He cannot save people directly; He must do it through us. Not even the angels have been appointed by God with such a commission for the carrying out of God’s desire. This commission has been entrusted only to man. For the carrying out of this commission, we need to pray. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496546" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span>, both Peter and Cornelius were praying. Peter was praying on the housetop, and Cornelius was praying in his house. From both sides, prayer ascended to the throne of God for the carrying out of God’s desire. By means of this prayer, God could accomplish His desire to save the Gentiles. The first Gentile household to be saved was that of Cornelius. This one example shows that our prayer is crucial for the carrying out of God’s desire for man’s salvation.</p>
