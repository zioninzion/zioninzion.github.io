    <h2 data-content-id="Lk-Y8IgKAENvtpi-aXiWGA3Kwo72tlHTCdc_QnauNmed86aHaofflJiWKbPxeJBoB" class="head1">THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="mEOSh_WV6MwzxOf7ZMsuyiY0hKCB7Xqh7CINCM8VWjxtHgRmOmzGSBshLSiOE25xk"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200748" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">verse 15</span> the word for <em>house</em> can also be rendered “household.” The church is God’s household, His family, His “folks.” The church’s being the household of God indicates that the church has a relationship in life with God through birth. All those who belong to the church are born of God and thus are God’s household. Here the matter of life is crucial. We could never be the household of God if we were not born of God and if we did not have a life relationship with Him. However, since we are children of God who were born of Him and have a life relationship with Him, we are the household of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="200749" data-verses="1John 3:1">1 John 3:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200750" data-verses="Ephesians 2:19">Eph. 2:19</span>). We are not like the angels, who are servants in the household of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="200751" data-verses="Hebrews 1:14">Heb. 1:14</span>). We are the household of God, the family of God, itself, for the church has been begotten of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="200752" data-verses="John 1:12-13">John 1:12-13</span>). This is a foundational and basic matter regarding the church. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="ZX7gXTc3Ot54gMnxcvmSJaQrmzxZ_vqhZ6lbyaD2Y_5JP0lBffpBB7cCXexrmTw8R" class="head1">THE ASSEMBLY</h2><p data-content-id="gUfzAeXOLaV0PoCOLIAQEWkCKxxkUL2ddSV1KYd0mLIzDtkbhxHIi-UGe9XDSRF6f"> Second, the church is the assembly of God, that is, the people of God meeting together. The Greek word for <em>church</em> is <em>ekklesia,</em> which denotes a called-out congregation meeting together. Hence, the church is an assembly, a meeting of God’s people. As Christians, we should not cease our assembling together (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="200753" data-verses="Hebrews 10:25">Heb. 10:25</span>). We must meet together because as the church we are by nature a meeting people. If we stop coming to the meetings, in our experience we will lose this important aspect of the church’s nature. </p>
    <p data-content-id="eb6LpHI8Y2TNWq3VFtdzzafeeq4QsX_TNtnBLg2OAI9c9MVIOyb2EzxPVEvkMtbAu"> We are the <em>ekklesia,</em> the meeting people. Specifically, we are the meeting people of the living God. This means that whenever we meet together, we must have the move of the living God in our midst. Whenever we Christians meet together, we must have the testimony of the living God. We must have God living in us in our experience, for He is the living God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="200754" data-verses="Acts 14:15">Acts 14:15</span>). </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="5zryA9oHUiBiMl1jZrS29WBl5U85wBMoXxXZVrEOLWIWl16CoKSDhSqlryZTPtZcw" class="head1">THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE REALITY</h2><p data-content-id="NzvVk_evty5Da1uMV6_Q4W4Ajk4EoqbSbL2nXNKKa07ndKCCOB-rY4YSlqNBNdc3H"> The third aspect of the church according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200755" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span> is the pillar and base of the truth, that is, of the reality. The terms <em>pillar</em> and <em>base</em> are architectural terms that were used by the ancient Greeks and Jews. In ancient times, when the Greeks and the Jews constructed certain buildings, they first established the base. Then they <span id="453" data-page-id="453" class="pg"></span> constructed the pillars, which were columns that bore the weight of the buildings. The apostle Paul used these two elements of architecture as metaphors for the church. The church is the base with a pillar to bear the reality of God in the universe. God is the reality, and this reality is borne by the church as the pillar and base of the reality. Hence, the church is the pillar that stands upon the base to bear God as the reality. This base and pillar are a testimony to the whole universe, including the angels and especially the human beings, that God is the reality and that without God there would be only emptiness and vanity. We as the church must have God, for God is the reality, and the church is the pillar and base of the reality. </p>
    <p data-content-id="tARS8YnWDKkRlld1WMgYFUM3dchq4THCmcJbbzXlam5Tdbx4zC7fQUTFeMiVa3_gN"> Human beings talk much about love. Yet, though we have the term <em>love,</em> we do not have the reality of love unless we have God. This is because the reality of love is God Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="200756" data-verses="1John 4:16">1 John 4:16</span>). If we do not have God, we do not have love. As the pillar and base of the reality, the church must testify to men that if they do not have God, they have only the term <em>love</em> but not love itself, for only God Himself is the reality of love. This principle is true with all positive things. If we do not have God, we do not have genuine joy. Likewise, if we do not have God, we do not have real peace. People throughout the world, especially in the United Nations, talk much about peace. Yet regardless of how much they talk about peace, without God as the reality, they will not have peace. It seems that the more they talk about peace, the more peace disappears from among them. Instead of having peace, they have vanity and emptiness. The reality of peace is God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="200757" data-verses="Romans 15:33">Rom. 15:33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200758" data-verses="Romans 16:20">16:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200759" data-verses="Philippians 4:9">Phil. 4:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200760" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thes. 5:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200761" data-verses="Hebrews 13:20">Heb. 13:20</span>). The church’s function is to stand and bear the testimony that the reality of peace is God. Our God is reality. The church stands as a universal pillar upon a base, bearing the testimony that our God is the reality of the entire universe. The church testifies to the world that if people have God, they have the reality, and if they do not have God, they have only emptiness. </p>

It is as the mystery of godliness that the church bears witness that God is the reality. </p>

    <p data-content-id="MwnSGz9x1ju5wbguBiEXTyJOWx9V4clXd2X376pkVdWu3-HRRP8OVEdYG6jPGilIm">The last characteristic of the one referred to as the mystery of godliness is that he was “taken up in glory.” If the mystery of godliness were only Christ, His being taken up in glory would not be mentioned at the end of the verse. According to the sequence of historical events, Christ was taken up in glory before the gospel was preached among the nations. The fact that this verse places “taken up in glory” after “preached among the nations” indicates that the church too is taken up in glory. After Christ is preached to the nations and believed on in the world, the church will be taken up in glory. If this passage referred only to Christ, the last characteristic would have to be the fourth. In other words, Christ’s being taken up in glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="200764" data-verses="Mark 16:19">Mark 16:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200765" data-verses="Acts 1:9-11">Acts 1:9-11</span>) would have to be mentioned before His being preached among the nations and believed on in the world. Because the last item in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200766" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span> is “taken up in glory,” this verse implies that not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body is the manifestation of God in the flesh. Hence, in this verse we have a universal man, the Head and the Body, Christ and the church, as the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh. The mystery of godliness is thus the mystery of the mingling of God and man. </p>

To be justified in the Spirit, we must walk and live in our regenerated human spirit. If we walk and live in our spirit, we will have a justified life, that is, a life that can be justified by God. God is manifested in the flesh of those who are the mystery of godliness. However, we should not live by our flesh. Instead, we should live by our spirit. Through our living by our spirit, God will be manifested in our flesh. Although we are in the flesh, we should not live by the flesh; rather, we should live by the spirit. We must walk, live, and do things by the spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="200770" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">Gal. 5:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200771" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="200772" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Rom. 8:4</span>). In this way God becomes our living in our spirit and is manifested in our flesh. Such a living will be justified in the Spirit. </p>
