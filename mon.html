    <h2 data-content-id="68RyK5mt2_V7ifRt_n_lXrg-_9fh_KfxEVAG7Wnb6ffAGvf8Pw_jD9V2hQynV5qZK" class="head1">I. PAUL’S FAITHFULNESS</h2><p data-content-id="R_6JKLWQk_AwYtAkUNjHVGCjFYyi16biExsz68tTensM87bPFK3qourBfMoxeHEIZ">In Galatians we see that Paul was faithful, honest, frank, and bold. At the same time, he also displayed a spirit of meekness. He refers to such a spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487330" data-verses="Galatians 6:1">6:1</span>, where he says that those who are spiritual should restore the one overtaken in an offense in a spirit of meekness. In writing this Epistle, Paul was endeavoring to restore the Galatian believers who had been overtaken by their weakness. No doubt, in their subtlety the Judaizers had taken advantage of the weakness of the Galatian believers. Therefore, Paul exercised a spirit of meekness in order to restore the ones who had been overtaken. On the one hand, he was bold; on the other hand, he was meek in spirit. Regarding this, we all need to learn of Paul.</p>
    <p data-content-id="SBF0yExGNMWrriAVIlo4o98gB_emC-W-U8eXIEPIUozMXWmyDIHDUJ-7puxySHD4c">In dealing with the problem in Galatia, Paul faced a situation that was serious and very touchy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487332" data-verses="Galatians 4:20">4:20</span> he says that he was perplexed about the Galatians. He was puzzled, not knowing how to deal with these distracted believers. But even though Paul was puzzled, he did not play politics. On the contrary, he was still frank, honest, and bold.</p>
    <p data-content-id="gNrXwvweCZ6Ctgx4kEK9OVYlI5FQh_6dsKz7QCxFwOXPpwWpEMbT_s7y5XU41fncD">Playing politics is a form of lying. In the eyes of God, politics is more evil than an outright lie. This is the reason that the international political situation is so evil, so deplorable, in God’s sight. Many diplomats and ambassadors are experts at lying in a subtle way. Some have even been trained to behave in such a manner. The church is altogether another realm, another kingdom. In this realm, the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, there should not be any lying; neither should there be any playing of politics. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487333" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span> the Lord Jesus said that the devil, Satan, is the father of lies. Since playing politics is even worse than lying, it must also issue from the devilish father of lies. Because the playing of politics is so evil and devilish, negotiations can never bring peace among the nations. How can there be peace among nations when the representatives of those nations lie and play politics? In the church, the earthly embassy of the heavenly kingdom, there should be no playing of politics.</p>
    <p data-content-id="eZyTBzfDxj6wGxYPws9DCqahDHaXCmsnuj_2coErGfJ3dytrbr9vxkLuPtLmpXrmc">Paul, a good example of a heavenly ambassador, was not political in dealing with the Galatians. He spoke the truth in a frank way. You may feel that Paul was extreme in his frankness. Who else would use such a term as <em>false brothers</em>? Would <span id="47" data-page-id="47" class="pg"></span> you dare to call someone a false brother? Would you write a letter in which you speak of false brothers who have stolen in to spy out our freedom? Probably none of us would dare to be as frank as Paul was. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487334" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3:1</span> he addressed the believers as “foolish Galatians.” How bold, honest, and genuine Paul was! The Galatian believers certainly were foolish to turn from Christ to the law. They surely were foolish in following the Judaizers. Therefore, Paul addressed them in a bold and frank manner. Let us learn from him to be faithful and bold and not to play politics. If we lack grace or the wisdom, we may be quiet. But if we speak regarding a particular situation, we should not be political.</p>

    <p data-content-id="hvtlSkGQtaeQ03rnPTbU_q6tKiieBHTJNPKDzUEm7sx7HidpP4Zw_F6onI-dg3Chy">From Paul’s experience of going up to Jerusalem after fourteen years according to revelation, we learn that it is often more difficult not to go to a certain place than it is to go there. For example, it is easy for me to make the decision to fly to London. But to refrain from doing so for fourteen years may not be easy. This requires that I be restricted. Because Paul was <span id="48" data-page-id="48" class="pg"></span> restricted, he did not go to Jerusalem apart from revelation. However, at a certain time, according to revelation, he went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas and Titus.</p>
    <p data-content-id="UyJUZIm2zJsrL7yv5iVpENxcV43FunFa3WH0YUtxPb56PZ8EG6I3xMX_iunHAkVzx">Paul’s visit to Jerusalem refers to the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487340" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span>. The Judaizers had caused a great deal of trouble by telling the Gentile believers that they had to be circumcised in order to be saved. They were making circumcision a condition of God’s eternal salvation. This issue was extremely serious. According to revelation, Paul went up to Jerusalem to deal with the source of the problem. Paul did not go to Jerusalem to receive revelation or learn some new teachings. Rather, he went there according to revelation to deal with the source of a serious problem.</p>
    <p data-content-id="MywbEgtJUTPadJcfFrYhAFP8pMbXFJn-IeI8X-N8hnKCmU7WUM54XC6frHnZD0Dg4">In this matter Paul also is a pattern for us. We should learn from his example not to go anywhere or to take any action in a light way. On the contrary, we must be restricted by the Spirit in our spirit. Whenever we go to a certain place, we should move according to revelation.</p>
    <h2 data-content-id="VxG4uTvFdGWxSmr8NO5_TEiLjPOsJbAyX0ZMJzLyhPPknHcvQUuGrX-TkkTblUg-3" class="head2">B. Privately Laying the Gospel<br>Which He Proclaimed before Those of Repute</h2><p data-content-id="igMApy3J-OI5KpI7dy9A0iTdZiR7CBSBdWwFTjWVFTwRiLgkXa4wqfEYhJqmm7gG-">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487341" data-verses="Galatians 2:2">Galatians 2:2</span> Paul also says, “I laid before them the gospel which I proclaim among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of repute, lest perhaps I should be running, or had run, in vain.” In doing this, Paul also was restricted. If we were going up to Jerusalem in that situation, we probably would have gone up with a great deal of fanfare. Perhaps we would have sent out advertisements telling people that the apostle to the Gentile world was coming. This is the way practiced in today’s Christianity. Announcement of the coming of a well-known preacher or evangelist is made in advance in order to assure a large crowd. Paul, in contrast to the way of today’s Christianity, presented his gospel privately to certain ones. This indicates that he went up to Jerusalem privately with no intention of speaking before a large congregation. He simply wanted to contact the leading ones, the apostles and elders. This is according to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487342" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span>, which corresponds to the account in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487343" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span>. <span id="49" data-page-id="49" class="pg"></span> </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="1aJPw1nejVWulclFoj6Ks8fiHyobWE_Lrw8dLfaWvsB-YW3FkxgXsgC7uxPD1Au4x" class="head2">C. Not Even Titus Compelled to Be Circumcised</h2><p data-content-id="9TWEpUmbKzHEy9DsMBk7kUgdksvpVBbvNBa3Nvi3u8dP7NzkvWtwxp3dV2m17d60I">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487344" data-verses="Galatians 2:3">verse 3</span> Paul goes on to say, “But not even Titus, who was with me, though he is a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.” This indicates that in his move for the Lord’s testimony, Paul did not care for the observance of the law. Paul deliberately refused to have Titus circumcised. Paul’s purpose was to keep the truth. Since in Christ circumcision is over, to circumcise a believer would cause the truth to be blurred. Therefore, Paul did not compel Titus to be circumcised.</p>
    <p data-content-id="j4BSKkRWikYonYCYg46an14UCk3M-ezrK_5ToVp4MXa148MEM5p0vXa_SepWWBL9R">Judaism was built upon the God-given law with its three pillars: circumcision, the Sabbath, and the holy dietary regulations. All three were ordained by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487345" data-verses="Genesis 17:9-14">Gen. 17:9-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487346" data-verses="Exodus 20:8-11">Exo. 20:8-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487347" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Lev. 11</span>) as shadows of things to come (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487348" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">Col. 2:16-17</span>). Circumcision was a shadow of the crucifixion of Christ in its putting off of the flesh, as signified in baptism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487349" data-verses="Colossians 2:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). The Sabbath was a type of Christ as the rest for His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487350" data-verses="Matthew 11:28-30">Matt. 11:28-30</span>). The holy diet symbolized persons who are clean and persons who are unclean, those whom God’s holy people should contact and those they should not contact (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487351" data-verses="Acts 10:11-16">Acts 10:11-16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487352" data-verses="Acts 10:34-35">34-35</span>). Once Christ had come, all these shadows should have been terminated. Hence, the observance of the Sabbath was abolished by the Lord Jesus in His ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487353" data-verses="Matthew 12:1-12">Matt. 12:1-12</span>), the holy dietary regulations were annulled by the Spirit in Peter’s ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487354" data-verses="Acts 10:9-20">Acts 10:9-20</span>), and circumcision was counted as nothing in the revelation received by Paul in his ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487355" data-verses="Galatians 5:6">Gal. 5:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487356" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">6:15</span>). Furthermore, the law, the base of Judaism, has been terminated and replaced by Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487357" data-verses="Romans 10:4">Rom. 10:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487358" data-verses="Galatians 2:16">Gal. 2:16</span>). Thus, Judaism in its entirety is finished.</p>

In referring to this, we are not siding with Paul against Peter; we are simply speaking the facts.</p>

Having Eaten with Those of the Uncircumcision</h2><p data-content-id="fmfhbz1AF6AIMZaEOXL-1dXkOZvVBQ5OaSh3NeGqm496TlstkS9dE3GcgfqPlWVoj">When I first read these verses, I was shocked. I could hardly believe what I was reading. But since these verses were written by Paul, they must be true. I found it hard to believe that one who had been with the Lord Jesus for three and a half years and who had seen the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487380" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span> regarding the abolition of the Levitical diet could practice such hypocrisy. Nevertheless, in Antioch Peter did just this. No wonder he lost his place of leadership. He was disqualified because he was not faithful to the vision he had seen. He did not keep the truth according to the vision that he had received from the Lord.</p>
    <p data-content-id="IkHA9QyHvKCR_YDYqWy8TLYVCHyrHBP0VND44AwNSRbUcq1qcKRNt4hRjK8zY1GnA">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487381" data-verses="Galatians 2:12">Galatians 2:12</span> we see that before certain ones came from James, Peter continually ate with the Gentiles. This was against the customary practice of the Jews in keeping the observances of their law. If eating with the Gentiles was wrong, Peter should not have done it in the first place. Since he ate with them, he indicated that it was proper to do so.</p>
    <h2 data-content-id="HPOa4RF6-_xydYnlqVZOrRHzeXTXuVOK0uhhOGpLfN87ExBHBFrHkQvvtIRrYRie3" class="head2">B.

The fact that Peter shrank back proves that he was very weak in the pure Christian faith. He had received an exceedingly clear vision from the heavens concerning fellowship with the Gentiles, and he took the lead to put that vision into practice in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487382" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span>. What weakness and backsliding to shrink from eating with Gentile believers out of fear of those of the circumcision! No wonder he lost the leadership among the apostles.</p>
    <p data-content-id="kDasksB5vFMzwQXxkHSTrHD9accrQ40sSxIkGROXFEF4lQ_mMoAwUNq30jKQU6T_T">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487383" data-verses="Galatians 2:12">Galatians 2:12</span> Paul specifically points out that Peter feared those of the circumcision. This indicates that in Jerusalem there was an atmosphere that strongly favored the observance of circumcision. Probably all the Jewish believers in Jerusalem, including Peter, were still in favor of this practice.</p>
    <h2 data-content-id="Jw-2Gf2mLlG_9SktQaieFf2WBHVP2Lf2iZE2-EdZEFJ74DoreXntLhDSHOZINmBD-" class="head2">C.

It is almost incredible that Peter, the leading apostle, practiced hypocrisy in relation to the truth of the gospel.</p>
    <p data-content-id="aeWQtqKFOYnBmO7EwnLKXrl7V9pEP17-vuL5wHRu7wY8AcOXol_FRANp_pzniJbTy">At least twice in the New Testament we are told that Peter took the lead in a negative way and that others followed him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487385" data-verses="John 21:1">John 21</span> Peter led the way to go fishing. In this he was followed by some of the other disciples. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487386" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span> Peter practiced hypocrisy, and others followed him.</p>
    <p class="dots">…</p>
    <p data-content-id="0QU6n_wvA5F6iUYDEKiLkyx_IonCEp2pcO8EWrVIDRIXfePd4SxgWFsryaZa-CUC7">Because Peter and the others were hypocritical, Paul rebuked him when he “saw that they were not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487387" data-verses="Galatians 2:14">Gal. 2:14</span>). Peter was absolutely wrong, and Paul rebuked him to his face. He would not allow the clear truth of the gospel to be damaged. Probably Paul was the only one with the boldness to rebuke a leading apostle such as Peter. Thank the Lord for Paul’s faithfulness. If he had not been faithful there at Antioch, the truth of the gospel might have been blurred.</p>

    <p data-content-id="B975vS4XfDCPSG587QVTHjFBhmpLxx3_A7XpU4Mx2q0YqXZDKPWIXV1Y7RDil_Hea">We praise the Lord that through Paul’s faithfulness the truth of the gospel was preserved. Today it is crystal clear according to the New Testament that in Christ there is no circumcision. We have been set free from slavery under the law and from the bondage of circumcision. There is no need for us to keep the law or to be circumcised. Rather, we only need faith in Christ. Because of Paul’s faithfulness and boldness, this truth was preserved and has remained clear for us today. We thank the Lord for this.</p>
