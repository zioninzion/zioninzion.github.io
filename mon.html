    <p data-content-id="_2ImOEE5hqsWE7pvRGyzhIJRwcOX2qgi0typAuGLhGQLxk4-ZKxlACUERtRbKP7EW"> What is the Lord’s recovery? It is not so easy to answer this question. First of all, we must see the real significance of the word <em>recovery.</em> It means that something was there originally, yet it became lost. Now it must be recovered. Hence, when we speak of the Lord’s recovery, it means that the Lord had certain things in the beginning, which at a certain stage became lost. Now He must recover all the things that have become lost. </p>

Then the following verse tells us that the life was manifested: “(And the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us)” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="263795" data-verses="1John 1:2">v. 2</span>). That which was from the beginning was not only the Word of life but life itself. The Word of life is not a doctrine, a teaching, a thought, or a concept. The Word of life is just life itself. </p>
    <p data-content-id="rH2Q77B60XLKPAf1Bm4L1emT1ohIQ639wlaxgFN8Mbs4-71fSubQaEZAdt-1gIijm"> What is this life, and who is this life? By reading the entire Bible, we see that life is a person, even the divine person. Life is nothing less than God Himself. Anything that is less than God Himself is not life. In the beginning God Himself as the very life was there. There was not redemption, justification, sanctification, or anything but life. Life was there in the beginning because life is God Himself. <span id="350" data-page-id="350" class="pg"></span> </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="dnhNmxxqtrAApMuFKZOBUPdROaeBgjR3BRqAEuLLR0INHeewG-zn9qdrWkTvMwVUA" class="head1">MAN IN GOD’S IMAGE</h2><p data-content-id="QntVzLr8kpzJDazfivZUedIef9K1UNNJL_FJYAjOufeeeHMT6kVmKkFTIk9jPZsbf"> The first verse of the first chapter of the Bible tells us that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. It seems that creation was there from the beginning, but before creation God was there. We cannot find a verse that tells us that from the beginning it was a matter of creation. On the sixth day the final thing that God created was man. He created man in His own image (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="263796" data-verses="Genesis 1:26-27">Gen. 1:26-27</span>). Of the millions of God’s creatures, none but man was created in the image of God. Even the angels were not created in God’s image. We all appreciate the angels. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="263797" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psalm 8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="263798" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2</span> tell us that man is inferior to the angels. However, only you and I as human beings were created in God’s image. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="ncOAWRVEHXi3wSnTtqgwdSovyvo2PC2oWp7yD2cMU-OVF3VOhM8zDw54YNMNzHMNN" class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="6pOSjQP6fbdmIV9liSZUTx4xyzonloYjrIpBXNNQiHVuo8T4PjZDMw_O4npH3AKVU"> The second chapter of Genesis tells us that after God created man in His own image, He put him before a wonderful tree. It is called the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="263799" data-verses="Genesis 2:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>). Have you ever heard of a life tree? You have heard of an apple tree and a peach tree, but what is a life tree? A famous preacher just published a book in which he said that today the tree of life is past. He said that man cannot see or enjoy this tree anymore. This proves how poor today’s Christianity is. The tree of life is simply God Himself as life being offered to man in the form of food. Praise the Lord that it is still available today! </p>
    <p data-content-id="RZlP-KebkL2o-Tkrco6BB-vPE6RPB2U_HYUqZCF-5-x5KQGz5zs9o6JVED5YHHUof"> After God created man, He did not charge him to do anything. He did not tell Adam and Eve how to behave themselves or to worship Him. There was no behavior and no religion. He did not tell Eve that she must submit herself to Adam; neither did He tell Adam that he must love Eve. The second chapter of Genesis is not long. Not one of the Ten Commandments is mentioned there. But God did charge man to eat in a right way. He told him that if he ate of the wrong tree, he would die. And there is a strong inference in this chapter that if he ate of the tree of life, he would obtain life. </p>
    <p data-content-id="s0IM0vnV_d53RD3P58N-_caKB7VnPDugwICNqUU6EyrjbrCm_8ndik756xygk_O9v"> God’s intention is to minister life to man. To Him, life is very important. In the first two pages of the Bible, there is the tree of life, and at the end of the Bible, in the last two pages, there is also the tree of life: “He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the <span id="351" data-page-id="351" class="pg"></span> tree of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="263800" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Rev. 22:1-2</span>). At the end of the Bible, the tree of life is growing in the river of water of life. There is the life tree, the life river, and the life water. Everything there will be life, life, life. The Bible begins with life, and the Bible ends with life. Therefore, life was the very thing in the beginning. That which was from the beginning was life. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="wyEUmJiYUQ4YewMaqi-ypRoSRY6pkE9-TuRpKnnbuW0dQGqt_73dH_FG3FxIS5325" class="head1">CREATION, LIFE, AND REDEMPTION</h2><p data-content-id="LZrYAKc7Ir_6myVLZ279wIqSNJjZbq-Y8CwZONrDqeTLMyF9exmtPtPJtWwirAeLF"> If life is the very thing that was from the beginning, where do we place redemption and justification? These matters come much later than life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="263801" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> the first thing mentioned is a serpent. “Now the serpent was more crafty than any other animal of the field that Jehovah God had made” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="263802" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">v. 1</span>). After creation and life in the first two chapters, the serpent entered in the third chapter. By the serpent sin came in and man fell. But immediately after man fell, God promised that the seed of the woman would come to accomplish redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="263803" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">v. 15</span>). Redemption came much later than life. </p>
    <p data-content-id="mbypj45OwItVdrsFFAs1L5Ltty-9fB0mr-l7puohhHr2fGf_0f931Akp2vScFCgAl"> In the first chapter of the Gospel of John, we have all these things in a good sequence. The Gospel of John begins by saying that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="263804" data-verses="John 1:1">v. 1</span>). The third verse continues to say that all things came into being through Him. Following this, we read that in Him was life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="263805" data-verses="John 1:4">v. 4</span>). Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="263806" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span> John the Baptist declared Jesus as the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. So we see creation, life, and redemption, in that order. Redemption is not counted as the first item from the beginning. I am not belittling redemption, but if we would see what the Lord’s recovery is, we must realize that redemption was not from the beginning. That which was from the beginning was life. </p>
    <p data-content-id="ZmwMjb_0OK4nFT9kLXj9dyceyDoeFahDCwjIbu_-cYdTfE0JiOhP5-k11_p_USDKQ"> The Lord’s recovery today is first to recover the matter of life. The Jewish people boast that they have Jehovah Elohim as their God. They have the God of creation, not of redemption. They hold to the genuine God, the true God, the very God of creation, according to the Old Testament. But that is all. It is good that God has created the earth on which we live; but strictly speaking, what good is it merely to worship the God of creation? It is much better than worshipping idols, but still it is very short. </p>
    <p data-content-id="Aoj6EIzI4PIEEi7WTJfISwdEIlQDREdUcLhtanHFvKau3uCPS-Eh3ZqXTgnLU-2l3"> Let us go on then to consider the fundamental Christians. They are more advanced and improved. They have the God of redemption. <span id="352" data-page-id="352" class="pg"></span> They not only have Jehovah Elohim; they also have Jesus, which means “Jehovah the Savior.” This is much better. All the sound fundamental Christians have the God of redemption. But we all must realize that among the fundamental Christians the matter of life has been lost and missed. They use the term <em>life.</em> They even quote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="263807" data-verses="John 10:10">John 10:10</span>, where the Lord said that He came that we may have life and may have it abundantly. But if you check with them, they do not know what this life is, and they do not have much experience of life. It is very rare to meet a real Christian who is able to tell how he experiences life in a practical, daily way. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="F5iGLAujomUHigY6A8uvG8H7PAB3OBwjHWg-OuLvDPrKMVhW_EeUGQEKR0cg7oQGY" class="head1">ONLY TERMINOLOGY</h2><p data-content-id="CWDwPizgyt7s2myiIghrO8UMSbgfEU-w08vsAb2TTx19_S94KaBtmYQAig0TMGtMC"> Today’s Christianity has missed the matter of life. They have the terminology, but they do not have the actuality. Therefore, the Lord’s recovery is to recover first the matter of life. Simply to have God as our Creator is far from adequate. Even to have the God of redemption is not adequate. What we need is to have God as our life! <span class="verse" data-ref-id="263808" data-verses="1John 4:15">First John 4:15</span> says, “Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.” The word <em>abides</em> here is the same word that is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="263809" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>, where the Lord Jesus told us to abide in Him, and He will abide in us. This passage in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="263810" data-verses="1John 4:15">1 John 4:15</span> tells us clearly that if we confess that Jesus is the Son of God, we abide in God and God abides in us. If we are abiding in God, where is God? Is He in the heavens? Surely He is in the heavens, but if He is only in the heavens, how could we abide in Him? Do we really believe that word which says that we are abiding in God and God abides in us? All of today’s preachers and teachers tell us to look to God in the heavens. But if God abides in us, why must we look away to the heavens? </p>
    <p data-content-id="PFEjBpvMNzhnaVCFQY3UPEiBStjgPfU9hKep_LAKaJ8hHNdwEOVReeyTECW8ShxdX"> By pointing these things out, I am simply showing you that something which was from the beginning has been lost. It is here in the holy Word, but it is not in the experience of so many genuine, fundamental Christians. They have the God of creation, and they have the God of redemption. But they do not experience much in actuality of the God who abides in them as their life. </p>
    <h2 data-content-id="-bhtqB_bskeJnrwwtsL-fEBAZhqqyrpJgDg4R-XJOhIvNorw0nV8xnoSqhBVJ5N_1" class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="pet5U8e9jJwQR4agKbT2R51M5QEPhhHAe-ZQ2bybsIgnb3Hn5IMQ1Efmwd7ihEDzj"> What is life? Life is difficult to define, but it is easy to experience. Even human life is difficult to define. The medical doctors cannot tell us what human life is. We only know when the human life is gone. <span id="353" data-page-id="353" class="pg"></span> Then what is the divine life? It is really difficult to say. If we have God abiding in us, He will continually regulate us from within. As a wife, while you are exchanging words with your husband, the One who abides in you will tell you to stop. The abiding One will bother us all the time like this. I am sure that most of us have had this kind of experience. This is life. This is God abiding in us. When the sisters are going shopping, the abiding One may not like it. If they turn back, the abiding One will be happy. What is that? That is life. That is God abiding in us. </p>
    <p data-content-id="vT4GWhJXcEKoHPv_btIZlnGpb-UhTN02fMB3Sg6qNw9JoVQRFFpELq_-lZXOc7Fq8"> Before I came to this country, we brothers in the Far East deeply felt that in this age God had commissioned us with His recovery. Not many of us came to the Western world, but we were burdened that someday the Lord would send some of us to the Western world to share the Lord’s recovery with the dear saints. Some of our young people came to this country as students, and one of them gave us a report. She said that we should not expect the American believers to be like the Chinese brothers in China. When we asked what she meant, she explained that all the American people are so rich and modern that they would never leave their worldliness, even though they love the Lord. Then I came to this country and began the ministry in 1962. After a short time, I discovered that her word was absolutely wrong. There are young people loving the Lord who are not worldly. Their face and their way of dress are absolutely different from the worldly people. But my point is this: Who told them to express themselves this way? I am sure that it came from God abiding in them. This is life. In the Lord’s recovery there is no regulation that tells the sisters not to put anything on their face. Who gave them such a regulation? This is life! </p>
    <p data-content-id="WybWgcJkOul_fLu10UDfVOQ2AOkwHXekNCTNacrv0ywQjsjTngkgtL1buKsfErnjj"> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God. Is this just a verse in the Bible? Is this just a kind of saying or terminology? Or is this something very real to us? I can testify that by His mercy and grace this is more than real to me. Too many times when I was going to speak to my wife in a rebuking way, the Lord checked me from within. Then I would go to pray, “O Lord, forgive me. I need to apply Your precious blood.” What is this? This is life! This is abiding in God, and this is God abiding in us. We should not consider that the Lord’s recovery is just another piece of Christian work. It is not. This is not another movement in Christianity. First of all, it is the recovery of life. Our God is not only the God of <span id="354" data-page-id="354" class="pg"></span> creation and redemption. Surely He has created and redeemed us, but for what? Creation and redemption are for the goal of life. God created us in His image so that we might express Him in His image. But how could we express Him without Him as our life. It is impossible! Praise the Lord that today the very objective God who is far beyond us is now within us! He is not only in us but abiding in us. He is remaining in us all the time. Since the day we confessed that we are sinful and called on the name of the Lord, this very God has come into us, and from that time He has been abiding in us to be our life. He abides in us for our living. We must live by Him. This is the thing that has been lost in today’s Christianity. It is in the Bible, but it is not in most Christians’ experience. Therefore, the Lord is recovering the matter of life. </p>
