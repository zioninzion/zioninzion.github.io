    <p data-content-id="xvYYq6aRA-9eRLuUGyqLMst4v12AjRawgvkrYA5wHfstTGiYFQIMHxVVWju2zEJEd">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487244" data-verses="Galatians 1:13-16">Galatians 1:13-16</span> we see the matter of God’s Son versus man’s religion. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487245" data-verses="Galatians 1:13-14">Verses 13 and 14</span> present a vivid picture of man’s religion. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487246" data-verses="Galatians 1:13">verse 13</span> Paul says, “You have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it.” Here we see a contrast between the Jewish religion and the church of God. When Paul was in Judaism, he persecuted the church because the church was different from his religion. Paul hated the church because it detracted from his religion. In his religious zeal, he persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it.</p>
    <p data-content-id="rAqTS5gc3Z33VVmcZILiXWvy10HpTntnyOn-0yghHBtJWJwwIZ_V3dvcpgYBREgYj">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487247" data-verses="Galatians 1:14">verse 14</span> Paul goes on to say, “And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.” The traditions here were those in the sect of the Pharisees, to which Paul belonged. He called himself “a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487248" data-verses="Acts 23:6">Acts 23:6</span>). The Jewish religion was composed not only of the God-given law and its rituals but also of man-made traditions. Because Paul was so zealous for the traditions of his fathers, he became a leading religionist and advanced beyond many of his contemporaries.</p>

God could bear <span id="20" data-page-id="20" class="pg"></span> with Saul’s zeal for the traditions of his fathers, for this produced a dark background against which to reveal Christ. At a time that was pleasing to Him, God revealed His Son in Saul of Tarsus. God was pleased to reveal to him the living person of the Son of God. To reveal His Son in us is also a pleasure to God. It is Christ, the Son of God, not the law, in whom God the Father is always pleased (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487250" data-verses="Matthew 3:17">Matt. 3:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487251" data-verses="Matthew 12:18">12:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487252" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">17:5</span>).</p>

The desire of God’s heart is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487259" data-verses="John 17:3">John 17:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487260" data-verses="John 3:16">3:16</span>), and become the sons of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487261" data-verses="John 1:12">1:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487262" data-verses="Galatians 4:5-6">Gal. 4:5-6</span>). As the Son of the living God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487263" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">Matt. 16:16</span>), Christ is far superior to Judaism and its traditions (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487264" data-verses="Galatians 1:13-14">Gal. 1:13-14</span>). The Judaizers bewitched the Galatians into considering that the ordinances of the law were above the Son of the living God. Hence, in the opening of this Epistle, the apostle testified that he had been deeply involved and had become far advanced in the realm of Judaism, but that God had rescued him out of that course of the world, which was evil in God’s eyes, by revealing His Son in him. In his experience Paul realized that there was no comparison between the Son of the living God and Judaism with its dead traditions handed down from his forefathers.</p>
    <p data-content-id="L4BCY0QQGKR-z3E8FG_zidLM2mW_JLe-KGoy8l3dCQTHHyPG9sMHKynhXqNrhanF1">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487265" data-verses="Galatians 1:16">1:16</span> Paul emphasizes the fact that the Son of God was revealed in him. This indicates that God’s revealing of His Son to us is in us; it is not outward but inward, not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing. It is not an objective revelation but a subjective one.</p>
    <p data-content-id="m9y3qFG2nEmFdNxtdICg028SfaKALsy10saJdyCAnFjmUsq3WDV1Kd_ufVlyQq0vq">God made the apostle Paul a minister of Christ by setting him apart, calling him, and revealing His Son in him. Therefore, what Paul announced was not the law but Christ the Son of God. Furthermore, he did not merely announce the doctrine concerning Christ; he announced Christ as a living person.</p>

This was true at the time of Saul of Tarsus, it has been true throughout the centuries, <span id="21" data-page-id="21" class="pg"></span> and it is true today. Instead of focusing his attention on this living person, man has a natural tendency to direct his attention to religion with its tradition. But from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487266" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487267" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>, the Bible reveals a living person. God cares only for this living person, not for anything else.</p>
    <p data-content-id="FgPSm7lv8-jCoHzNjSCZLb4xMw6Djy6Svmwjlq3vOM_WSIe0ieHbTvJo1wwamm0W3">The record of the experience of the disciples with the Lord Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration illustrates this (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487268" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-8">Matt. 17:1-8</span>). After bringing Peter, James, and John up to a high mountain privately, the Lord Jesus “was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487269" data-verses="Matthew 17:2">v. 2</span>). Along with the other two disciples, Peter saw the Lord’s glory. He also saw Moses and Elijah speaking with Him. Although it is doubtful that Moses and Elijah were in glory, they nonetheless were speaking with the glorified Jesus. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487270" data-verses="Matthew 17:4">Matthew 17:4</span>, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.” In making this suggestion, Peter was elevating Moses and Elijah to the same level as that of the Lord Jesus. He was heir of the centuries-old tradition concerning Moses, who represented the law, and Elijah, who represented the prophets. To the Jews, Moses and Elijah were the representatives of the entire Old Testament. Hence, even on the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter was zealous for the traditions regarding Moses and Elijah. But while Peter was still speaking, “behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487271" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">v. 5</span>). Moses and Elijah then disappeared from the scene. When the disciples lifted up their eyes, “they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487272" data-verses="Matthew 17:8">v. 8</span>). This indicates that in the eyes of God there is no place for religion or tradition—only the living person of His Son has a place.</p>

Speaking of Christ does not lead to the same kind of involvement as does speaking of the Son. The reason for this difference is that whenever we speak of the Son of God, we are immediately involved with the Father and the Spirit. According to the writings of Paul, to have the Son is to have both the Father and the Spirit. As we have pointed out repeatedly, the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the Spirit for our enjoyment. Hence, when Paul says that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him, this means that the One revealed in him was the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the processed all-inclusive Spirit. The burden I have received from <span id="25" data-page-id="25" class="pg"></span> the Lord is to minister this matter to God’s chosen people. Although I have been ministering on this for many years, I can testify that this burden is heavier today than ever before.</p>
    <p data-content-id="XG1qdH73elFV926fgt1LgeQj7h-kH7RSAy6xV3Z9_nsbzMNpiurcBpI2_EAY3W-AS">In Paul’s Epistles we see that the Son is the mystery of God, the embodiment of God, and the One in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487287" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">Col. 2:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487288" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">9</span>). One day, through incarnation, the Son of God became a man called the last Adam, who, through death and resurrection, has become the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487289" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487290" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span> Paul says, “The Lord is the Spirit.” Putting all these verses together, we see that the Son of God, the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, became a man and that in resurrection this One is now the life-giving Spirit.</p>
    <p data-content-id="kDasksB5vFMzwQXxkHSTrHD9accrV400SxIkGROXFEF4lQ_mMoAwUNq30jKQU6T_T">Concerning Christ as the Son of God, there are two “becames.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487291" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, the Word, the Son of God, became flesh; that is, He became a man. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487292" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>, this One, called the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit. This is the reason that Paul can say explicitly that now the Lord is the Spirit. The Son of God is thus the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the all-inclusive Spirit. This wonderful person is versus man’s religion.</p>
    <h2 data-content-id="8dBuSopZm16j3LCbMbeQ_ETFGlMT_HPbPscwLelykGcZ0AsUwhCBB7wAl5r98UMCJ" class="head1">THE LIVING PERSON VERSUS ALL THINGS</h2><p data-content-id="0QU6n_wvA5F6iUYDEKiLkyx_IonCBp2xcO8EWrVIDRIXfePd4SxgWFsryaZa-CUC7">Though we have a good deal of knowledge of Bible doctrine, our burden is not to minister doctrine; it is to minister the living Son of God as the embodiment of the processed Triune God realized as the life-giving Spirit. We should not treasure anything, including our Bible knowledge or spiritual experience and attainments, in place of this living person. Daily and hourly, we need to experience this living person. The church is the Body of this person, His practical and living expression.</p>
    <p data-content-id="7QMMJN0S38w9VYs4RWW3Pdr8rKFIe93ZAA6hwncGOSgrNv9t_td1jki749I99qv-Y">Because this living person is everything to us, there is no need for us to seek mere holiness, spirituality, victory, love, or submission. As the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, He is within us to be whatever we need. In a forthcoming message we will see that this One is now living in us. What we lack is not holiness or victory—it is this living person. He is versus everything. Without Him everything is a tradition made either by others or by ourselves. May we all see that today this living person is versus all things.</p>
