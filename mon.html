Probably he wrote this Epistle from Macedonia, which is made up of what is today northern Greece and southern Bulgaria. <span id="8" data-page-id="8" class="pg">[8]</span> </p>

All such teaching was vain talking (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496423" data-verses="1Timothy 1:6">v. 6</span>), differing from the apostles’ teaching, which was centered on Christ and the church, that is, on the economy of God.</p>
    <p data-content-id="vqETgg61QZIr8ETGagXiDFLfsRILTGtxjXWRGj7r-FtC8N-IDN0BHuOQOCEfeoVVc">Paul’s Epistles are the completion of the divine revelation concerning God’s eternal purpose and economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496424" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">Col. 1:25</span>). His ministry completes the revelation concerning the all-inclusive Christ and His universal Body, the church as His fullness to express Him. Concerning the church as the Body of Christ, there are two sides: life and practice. From Romans through 2 Thessalonians, a full revelation is given concerning the life of the church, including the nature, responsibility, and function of the church. Now, from 1 Timothy through Philemon, a detailed revelation concerning the practice of the church is presented. This pertains to the administration and shepherding of a local church. For this the first thing needed is to terminate the different teachings of the dissenters, which distract the saints from the central line and ultimate goal of God’s New Testament economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496425" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4-6">1 Tim. 1:4-6</span>).

It refers to words, speeches, and conversations concerning such things as rumors, reports, true or false stories, and fictions.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496438" data-verses="1Timothy 1:5-6">1 Timothy 1:5 and 6</span> Paul says, “The end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith; from which things some, having misaimed, have turned aside to vain talking.” The charge in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496439" data-verses="1Timothy 1:5">verse 5</span> refers to the charge mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496440" data-verses="1Timothy 1:3">verse 3</span>. The different teachings of the dissenting ones, mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496441" data-verses="1Timothy 1:3">verse 3</span>, caused envy and discord among the believers. Such envy and discord are contrary to love, the end of the apostle’s charge. To carry out the apostle’s charge, love, which is out of a pure heart, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith, is needed.</p>
    <p data-content-id="JxrnxHzHcfIKdI0od4u_4KLDt92CQjd0G8MTSP-cUkdeHTLwpOQiFIX9ySpJa_BPH">A pure heart is a single heart without mixture, a heart that seeks only the Lord and takes the Lord as the unique goal. A good conscience is a conscience without offense (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496442" data-verses="Acts 24:16">Acts 24:16</span>). Unfeigned faith, related to the faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496443" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span>, is faith without pretense or hypocrisy, faith that purifies the heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496444" data-verses="Acts 15:9">Acts 15:9</span>) and operates through love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496445" data-verses="Galatians 5:6">Gal. 5:6</span>). In order to deal with the different teachings when the trend of the church is toward decline, all these attributes are required. They are necessary if we are to have a pure, true, and genuine love.</p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496448" data-verses="1Timothy 1:7">1:7</span>, those who desire to be teachers of the law confidently affirm certain things. The Greek for <em>confidently affirm</em> can also be rendered “strongly affirm” or “emphatically affirm.” The same word is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496449" data-verses="Titus 3:8">Titus 3:8</span>.</p>
    <p data-content-id="bZgeXV2w_VpGrGKylj9h2EppDKtwO0SGY1W_5n3t759CoSuQsa-_l7Td_g7coM4-i">According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496450" data-verses="1Timothy 1:8-10">1 Timothy 1:8-10</span>, the law is good if used lawfully. Paul says that the “law is not enacted for a righteous man but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and those who strike their mothers, for murderers, for fornicators, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and whatever other thing that is opposed to the healthy teaching.”</p>

The sound teaching of the apostles, which is according to the gospel of the glory of God, ministers the healthy teaching as the supply of life to people, either nourishing them or healing them. In contrast, the different teachings of the dissenting ones in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496451" data-verses="1Timothy 1:3">verse 3</span> sow the seeds of death and poison into others. Any teaching that distracts people from the center and goal of God’s New Testament economy is not healthy.</p>

God’s Economy</h2><p data-content-id="8WRSaojdfzVDCtCnSPtWBtyRFfEBujqIR1_mttyRhr5lYjtAFBstnRv9hHVKg_P58">In Greek the words <em>God’s economy</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496452" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">1:4</span> also mean God’s “household law,” implying distribution. (The base of this word is of the same origin as that for <em>pasture</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496453" data-verses="John 10:9">John 10:9</span>, implying a distribution of the pasture of the flock.) It denotes a household management, a household administration, a household government, and, derivatively, a dispensation, a plan, or an economy for administration (distribution); hence, it is also a household economy. God’s economy in faith is His household economy, His household administration, which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496454" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Tim. 3:15</span>), the Body of Christ. The apostle’s ministry was centered on this economy of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496455" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">Col. 1:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496456" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:17">1 Cor. 9:17</span>), whereas the different teachings of the dissenting ones were used by God’s enemy to distract His people from this economy. In the administration <span id="11" data-page-id="11" class="pg">[11]</span> and shepherding of a local church, this divine economy must be made fully clear to the saints.</p>
    <p data-content-id="0Z5V0AAorzeep8wwcngQb_tXHSfUNR172KrLumMZ0crQlGS5suS9LJ8kO1uffKnX9">In the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496457" data-verses="1Timothy 1:1">first chapter</span> of 1 Timothy, the apostle Paul presented God’s economy in opposition to different teachings. God’s economy is in faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496458" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">v. 4</span>), whereas the different teachings are based on the principle of the law and centered on the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496459" data-verses="1Timothy 1:7-10">vv. 7-10</span>). Hence, faith is versus the law, as dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496460" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496461" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496462" data-verses="Galatians 3:5">5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496463" data-verses="Galatians 3:23-25">23-25</span>). Any teaching that is based on the principle of the law and centered on the law is unhealthy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496464" data-verses="1Timothy 1:10">1 Tim. 1:10</span>). Only God’s economy, which is in faith, in opposition to the teachings that are based on the principle of the law and centered on the law, is healthy and can make it possible for people to believe on Christ unto eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496465" data-verses="1Timothy 1:16">v. 16</span>) and to thus participate in God’s eternal plan, God’s economy, which is in faith. This is the gospel of glory with which the blessed God entrusted the apostle Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496466" data-verses="1Timothy 1:11">v. 11</span>). If anyone thrusts away such faith and a good conscience, regarding the faith, he becomes shipwrecked on a deep sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496467" data-verses="1Timothy 1:19">v. 19</span>).</p>

The dispensing of God into us is altogether by faith. The economy of God is a matter in faith, that is, a matter that is initiated and developed in the sphere and element of the faith. God’s economy, which is to dispense Himself into His chosen people, is not in the natural realm or in the work of law but in the spiritual sphere of the new creation through regeneration by faith in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496471" data-verses="Galatians 3:23-26">Gal. 3:23-26</span>). By faith we are born of God to be His sons, partaking of His life and nature to express Him. By faith we are put into Christ to become the members of His Body, sharing all that He is for His expression. This is God’s plan, God’s dispensation, which is carried out in faith, according to His New Testament economy.</p>
    <p data-content-id="OXR8ZCU9jugKJ7vu8MvBMZfDk3KSRVOIqtM52h7jqairFduBpdknjB1z7f1WqjwSb">We need to be deeply impressed with the meaning of faith in the New Testament. We have spoken much about this in our life-studies of Romans, Hebrews, and Galatians. Faith is first God being the Word spoken to us. We have God and then God as the Word spoken. Through the Word of God and by the Spirit of God we are infused with God in Christ. As a result, something rises up within us. This is faith. Faith then works in us to bring us into an organic union with the Triune God. Through this organic union God is continually transfused and infused into us. As a result, we have the divine life and the divine nature to become God’s sons, members of Christ, and parts of the new man. As a totality, we become the house of God, the Body of Christ, and the new man. This is God’s economy in faith.</p>

This gospel not only brings good news concerning forgiveness of sins and justification by faith; the gospel of glory is the gospel of God’s economy. Glory is God expressed. Thus, the gospel of glory is the gospel of the expressed God; it is a gospel that expresses God’s glory.</p>
    <p data-content-id="3XtPvs_Frl9WXTbVN5sAU7qn_8jEwrpjsnHGjlByZ4BS_jiY_75r4kKFE6_dkxHmb"><em>The gospel of the glory of the blessed God</em> is an excellent expression. It refers to God’s economy mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496473" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">verse 4</span>. The gospel with which the apostle Paul was entrusted is the effulgence of the glory of the blessed God. By dispensing God’s life and nature in Christ into His chosen people, this gospel shines forth God’s glory, in which God is blessed among His people. This is the commission and ministry the apostle received of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496474" data-verses="1Timothy 1:12">v. 12</span>). This should be commonly taught and preached in a local church.</p>
    <p data-content-id="G47a1jZQNox-p0lvlK0r3DNQDsrf7_No02ifeD4g9r67-xl8DB14SV2dwYFjoPCTQ">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496475" data-verses="1Timothy 1:12">verse 12</span> Paul says, “I give thanks to Him who empowers me, Christ Jesus our Lord, that He has counted me faithful, appointing me to the ministry.” The Lord not only appointed the apostle to the ministry and commissioned him with God’s economy outwardly but also empowered him inwardly to carry out His ministry and fulfill His commission. This is altogether a matter of life in the Spirit.</p>

The Foremost Sinner</h2><p data-content-id="DElAY2acfb04o0fYBiQWroCO5rcsT0VCRI63D7DitAknUYqC4fnt0r_sAdKNS_TwX">Paul says that he was a foremost sinner (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496477" data-verses="1Timothy 1:15-16">vv. 15-16</span>). He was a blasphemer of God, a persecutor of man, and an insulting person with respect to the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496478" data-verses="1Timothy 1:13">verse 13</span> he says of himself, “Who formerly was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insulting person; but I was shown mercy because, being ignorant, I acted in unbelief.” A blasphemer is one who blasphemes God, and a persecutor is one who persecutes man. Saul of Tarsus, a strict Pharisee (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496479" data-verses="Acts 22:3">Acts 22:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496480" data-verses="Philippians 3:4-5">Phil. 3:4-5</span>), could never have blasphemed God. But he did speak evilly of the Lord Jesus. Here he confessed that this was blasphemy. This indicates that he believed in the deity of Christ. <span id="14" data-page-id="14" class="pg">[14]</span> </p>
    <p data-content-id="Sk4GNToSfl8w3AQTW-xN54grvI1yHwupxqb49WyThJh4vOaZcWJHMRUjrwxPN_wVc">Saul of Tarsus persecuted the church in an insulting, destructive way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496481" data-verses="Acts 22:4">Acts 22:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496482" data-verses="Galatians 1:13">Gal. 1:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496483" data-verses="Galatians 1:23">23</span>), just as the insulting Jews persecuted the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496484" data-verses="Matthew 26:59">Matt. 26:59</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496485" data-verses="Matthew 26:67">67</span>).</p>
    <p data-content-id="gSuPGfnOObDZW5B6QAAgac12QzV8lIjoDEAIHK5ZxZ8bDtkbhxHIi-UGe9XDSRF6f">Paul also says that he was ignorant and acted in unbelief. To be ignorant means to be in darkness, and unbelief comes from blindness. Saul of Tarsus was in darkness and acted in blindness when he opposed God’s New Testament economy.</p>

Saul, a blasphemer and persecutor, first was shown mercy and then received grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496487" data-verses="1Timothy 1:14">v. 14</span>). Mercy reaches farther to the unworthy one than grace does. Because Saul was one who blasphemed God and persecuted man, God’s mercy reached him before the Lord’s grace did.</p>

Faith and love are products of the Lord’s grace. Mercy and grace come to us from the Lord; faith and love return to the Lord from us. This is a spiritual traffic between the Lord and us. Faith is for us to receive the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496489" data-verses="John 1:12">John 1:12</span>), and love is for us to enjoy the Lord whom we have received (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="496490" data-verses="John 14:21">14:21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496491" data-verses="John 14:23">23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="496492" data-verses="John 21:15-17">21:15-17</span>).</p>

He was God incarnated to be a man that He might save us through His death and resurrection in His human body. In a local church this should be constantly announced as the glad tidings.</p>

Amen.” This word needs to be understood in relation to the decline of the church. When Paul was in prison, the churches began to decline, and the situation was very disappointing. Many were discouraged. Even some of Paul’s co-workers left him. But he had a strong faith with an absolute assurance that the very God in whom he believed, the One who had entrusted him with the gospel of glory, is the King of the ages. He never changes. No earthly king can be called <em>the King of the ages.</em> Caesar was a temporary ruler, but how different is our God! The God whom Paul served truly is the King of the ages. This means that He is King of eternity. He never changes; He always remains the same.</p>
    <p data-content-id="T9wSLLzXi160Y60CZaKQ-itNO45w_rHnrBFvesCgvwNvQXOSa8trvEIxit9yPQ7o7">Everything except God is corruptible. The church may decline, deteriorate, and become degraded, but God is incorruptible. Paul also says that God is invisible. God is powerful, everlasting, incorruptible, and also invisible. We cannot see Him. Certain terms ascribed to God in this verse are used only in this book. With Paul, we need to use these words to praise God. I would encourage someone to write a suitable melody for the singing of this verse. In a living, released way, we need to declare, “Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.”</p>
