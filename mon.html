        <h2 data-content-id="7ZkkFhp5QemEIl5JwsIOoysYeLTtQl62l1ATEW3x1kLIHg5KyT4rI4wqEwdPZ-ck8" class="head1"> THE GENUINE CHRISTIAN PERFECTION<br>AS TAUGHT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="_zwkXJ2919oGRTsy0SLkumtvQBI0ckf__oUpciFgAEu8h3RQ5RLl8KWHpiQXBX882"> We need to be reminded of the genuine Christian perfection as taught in the New Testament. In order to see the genuine Christian perfection, we need to see the revelation of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the genuine, real Christian perfection. </p>
        <p data-content-id="BosN9x-NoFk8JVoilJN2fGflzwi_vLMbQKtSAfpxoVmq8BLds2caH0kPqj2vc3If8"> The New Jerusalem has a strong base, and this strong base is God the Father's divine nature, signified by gold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="376219" data-verses="Revelation 21:18">Rev. 21:18b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="376220" data-verses="Revelation 21:21">21b</span>). The holy city is a golden mountain. Surely, that is strong and sufficient to bear any weight. The entire holding strength of the holy city is God's divine nature, and this base should be the base of our Christian life and work. The base, the gates, and the wall of the city are the basic building, whereas the throne, the temple, and the light are the furnishings. The intrinsic significance of all these items shows us what the genuine Christian perfection is. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of the Body of Christ, so the genuine Christian perfection is also the Body of Christ, which is the aggregate of all the God-men living the life of the God-man. </p>

In the Lord's recovery the Christian perfection is the living of the God-man. </p>

        <p data-content-id="-beNYJpDY_H62wSUVPU3C18eNe49VDc9njh2SM_PDhiqI7eT5AaDL7s8amgQ5vfjW"> Such a Christian perfection is the issue of the dispensing of the processed and consummated Triune God into the believers, the God-men, by God the Father as the source, the origin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="376221" data-verses="Matthew 5:48">Matt. 5:48</span>). The Father in His nature is the golden base of the New Jerusalem as its source, its origin. <span id="416" data-page-id="416" class="pg"></span> </p>

This is typified by the pearl gates of the New Jerusalem. An oyster (Christ) lives in the salty water (the world of death) and is wounded by a grain of sand (crucified for the sinner) to produce a pearl by secreting its life-juice (dispensing His life element). The Father is the base, and the Son is the element. </p>

By these six steps the Spirit, as the third of the Divine Trinity, will finish His transforming work to make us completed pearls. </p>

The grace of Christ, God the Son, and the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Spirit as the third of the Trinity are with us all the time secreting the Triune God in His life element around us to perfect us. James's perfection is far off from this. <span id="417" data-page-id="417" class="pg"></span> </p>
