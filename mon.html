          <p data-content-id="QYKxbzY7Q47slmz8u_0hc7g2FTEb3RpuaCDvjDS50eDDQPy84sBEZQYIyWwSaV0rY"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="376243" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">Second Timothy 3:16a</span> says, “All Scripture is God-breathed,” that is, written by the breathing of God, through the inspiration of the Spirit of God, indicating clearly that all the sixty-six books of the Holy Scriptures were written through the inspiration of the Spirit of God. </p>
          <h2 data-content-id="KxrSzmncTas7QsgCwOHOW67AS-4KSOwudikuCdpU3jLp7tYI5ELvatAaWXgU2Q4s2" class="head2"> Not Every Word Written<br>through the Spirit of God Being the Word of God</h2><p data-content-id="ltgZic4r1VUpsHgOUU17z8ACqDY8I6m3EgTIOVwQwHrVBzohU_E5Utqhvc70SscIc"> The entire Scriptures were written by inspiration of the Spirit of God, but this does not mean that every word written through the Spirit of God as a portion of the Holy Scriptures is the word of God. Many portions of the Holy Scriptures are rather the words spoken by persons (including Satan) other than God. I would like to present seven evident illustrations to show this. Three are from the Old Testament. First, there is Satan’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="376244" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>. Second, there are Job and his three friends plus Elihu in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="376245" data-verses="Job 3:1">Job 3—37</span>. The third illustration from the Old Testament is the psalmists’ natural sentiment. Three illustrations from the New Testament are concerning Peter, and the fourth one is concerning James. <span id="419" data-page-id="419" class="pg"></span> </p>
          <h2 data-content-id="ORgAQD1tho3TSsbr6Jcpkeu3_0fqRerN2_Ityyu-kICrFduBpdknjB1z7f1WqjwSb" class="head3">The Serpent’s Word Recorded by Moses</h2><p data-content-id="4OzZUhrFapuK1kiYCMt08oj_3aJmvnjGNlgFK-Jq4WNjHc7P8zvvj57x3lMDq7I4C"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="376246" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3:1b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="376247" data-verses="Genesis 3:4-5">4-5</span> is the word spoken by the old serpent, the devil, but recorded by Moses through the inspiration of the Spirit of God for God’s purpose to expose His enemy Satan’s subtle deceiving and his devilish temptation that mankind may know that Satan is a real deceiver and devilish tempter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="376248" data-verses="1Timothy 2:14">1 Tim. 2:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="376249" data-verses="Matthew 4:1-3">Matt. 4:1-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="376250" data-verses="Matthew 6:13">6:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="376251" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:5">1 Thes. 3:5</span>). Satan’s word is recorded in the Bible, and that record is by the inspiration of the Spirit, but the word recorded is not the word of God. The serpent said, “Did God really say, You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?...You shall not surely die! For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="376252" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Gen. 3:1b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="376253" data-verses="Genesis 3:4-5">4-5</span>). This was Satan’s word, but it was recorded by Moses as a part of the Holy Scriptures. This shows that not every word recorded in the Bible is the word of God, but the record is by the inspiration of the Spirit. </p>
          <h2 data-content-id="o2ST8jcyhmbXhUb9A_zMdCpDjf0LvqFWN-yvtHhgyeEL44xn53-UHYzxiT_YtbFAP" class="head3"> The Speaking of Job,<br>His Three Friends, and Elihu</h2><p data-content-id="3RczmteVpjqPMEvQL8fo88bTk_28wgMmw1DSk2UvXqRS_jiY_75r4kKFE6_dkxHmb"> In the book of Job, thirty-five chapters, 3 through 37, are a record of the words spoken by Job, his three friends, and Elihu. All these five persons were God-fearing and God-seeking people, but the words spoken by them in the book of Job were very much according to their concepts concerning God’s will for man, their understanding of the meaning of human life, and their realization concerning the perfection of human virtues, all of which contradict God’s purpose in man, that is, that man should be filled with God to express God rather than all other things, including man’s perfection of human virtues. Hence, God stripped Job of his uprightness and integrity that he might seek God Himself instead of anything else. Yet their words, which were against God’s will in man, were written by them under the inspiration of the Spirit of God to serve the purpose of God to expose the mistake of Job, his three friends, and Elihu in knowing God that man may be enlightened to realize that, according to God’s good pleasure of His heart’s desire, man should be the expression of God only, rather than the expression of man’s perfection of his uprightness and integrity. </p>
          <p data-content-id="G-Km8i4APumnyjRqjPHDfE8kYv-n70otokmLWQt9z4a7-xl8DB14SV2dwYFjoPCTQ"> After the speaking by those five persons in thirty-five chapters, God came in to rebuke Job by telling him that he darkened God’s <span id="420" data-page-id="420" class="pg"></span> counsel by words without knowledge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="376254" data-verses="Job 38:1-2">38:1-2</span>). Some colleges use the book of Job to teach philosophy, but God told Job that his words were without knowledge. After the Lord finished His speaking, Job said to Him, “I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You; / Therefore I abhor myself, and I repent / In dust and ashes” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="376255" data-verses="Job 42:5-6">42:5-6</span>). Once Job saw God, he abhorred himself and repented. No doubt, he gained God instead of his perfection, uprightness, and integrity. </p>
          <p data-content-id="cy-6Gywu9YvfRWbpLmnEucNqaYYUTi7IAiksxQDQxF45PWUOTZ-RRGiE-kV0J-2I7"> Today who understands the book of Job? Even James did not understand it properly. He says that when we are suffering, we have to learn of the endurance of Job (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="376256" data-verses="James 5:10-11">James 5:10-11</span>). Job’s words without knowledge, however, darkened God’s counsel concerning man. God’s counsel concerning man is simple. He wants us to receive Him into us to be our everything, even to transform us into His image so that we can become His expression. The Christian perfection is for the expression of the Triune God, not for the expression of our integrity or uprightness. </p>
          <p data-content-id="YyuBiufT9eOWFZsJxBwCD_R22f65DPLccjulkCY74WBqKuuNDiVU30qLuBNV803Zo"> Job highly esteemed his perfection, integrity, and uprightness, so God came in to strip him of this. Then God showed Himself to Job, and Job abhorred himself and gained God. But just to abhor ourselves is not sufficient. The Lord Jesus said that whoever would follow Him must deny himself and take up his cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="376257" data-verses="Matthew 16:24">Matt. 16:24</span>). To deny the self is to leave the self on the cross. To bear the cross is to remain on the cross. In today’s Christianity there is a wrong thought that the cross is for suffering. This is the thought in the book <em>The Imitation of Christ.</em> We need to see, however, that the ultimate goal of the cross is not suffering but terminating. To bear the cross is a killing. Christ has crucified us on the cross, and we should remain there. We should leave ourselves on the cross. Then the self is terminated. James’s teaching of Christian perfection, though, is self-cultivation; it is to cultivate the bright virtue in man created by God. But the New Testament teaches that we have to deny ourselves and leave ourselves on the cross. </p>

Yet they were recorded by the Spirit of God in the Holy Scriptures to serve God’s purpose to expose the degree of the psalmists’ spirituality that, on the one hand, they loved God and sought God, but on the other hand, they were still so natural in their sentiment. While the psalmists were praising God, they were also asking God to avenge them. This is recorded in the Bible in order to let us know that regardless of how much we praise God, we can still be natural. </p>

Yet these words were written by James in <span id="425" data-page-id="425" class="pg"></span> his Epistle under the inspiration of God for the divine purpose to expose him in his wrong concept concerning the law and in his vague vision concerning God’s dispensation of the ages in order to teach and enlighten all the believers in Christ that they may know that they should not be frustrated by James’s defective words from going on further to seek the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the old-creation-terminating death of Christ, and the all-new-creation-germinating resurrection of Christ for the fulfillment of God’s eternal economy. </p>

          <p data-content-id="pHKvG524aq5yn0c5EKQCBO7kgNJT2FrJc2hUjCAd8i79utC3cgQPugIj-GPE_ryq2"> The first principle is that all Scripture should be interpreted with Scripture. Every portion, even a single word, of the Scripture should be interpreted with and according to the entire Scriptures. If any interpretation of the Epistle of James, as a book in the Scripture, is not interpreted according to the entire Scriptures, it becomes a book other than the Scripture. </p>

The interpretation of the Scripture should be strictly governed by this central line under its adequate enlightenment. If any interpretation of the Epistle of James is not in harmony with God’s economy, it is off. No saint of God who is a genuine seeker of the scriptural truth and who is enlightened with the central line of the Holy Scriptures would ever accept such an off-track interpretation that he might not be sidetracked as many have been. </p>
