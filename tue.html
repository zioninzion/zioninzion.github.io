The Churches in Galatia Bewitched<br>by the Judaizers</h2><p data-content-id="L4BCY0QQGKR-z3E8FG_zidLM2mW_LLe-CGoy8l3dCQTHHyPG9sMHKynhXqNrhanF1">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487158" data-verses="Galatians 1:2">1:2</span> Paul speaks of “the churches of Galatia,” a province of the ancient Roman Empire. Through Paul’s preaching ministry, churches were established in a number of cities in that province. Hence, <em>churches,</em> not <em>church,</em> was used when the apostle refers to the churches in Galatia collectively.</p>
    <p data-content-id="m9y3qFG2nEmFdNxtdICg028SfaKAJsy18saJdyCAnFjmUsq3WDV1Kd_ufVlyQq0vq">The churches in Galatia had been bewitched by the Judaizers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487159" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">3:1</span>). They had been distracted from Christ to Judaism. A good number of the New Testament believers in the churches of Galatia had turned back to the old Jewish religion and were endeavoring to keep the law with the ordinance of circumcision. This was the background that gave Paul the opportunity to write this wonderful book.</p>
    <p data-content-id="ZwCX3ZVND7d7lk1pebWCdpJAKOP8KYJ1foJG95iZjQPxHTGSyYSMzanPQO72pDk5d">In writing to the Galatians, Paul was very frank and straightforward; he was not in the least political. For example, he called those Judaizers who were troubling the Galatians “false brothers” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487160" data-verses="Galatians 2:4">2:4</span>). The Galatian believers had been bewitched by these false brothers.</p>

The Churches in Galatia Distracted<br>from Christ to Law</h2><p data-content-id="FgPSm7lv8-jCoHzNjSCZLb4xMw6Dhy6epmwjlq3vOM_WSIe0ieHbTvJo1wwamm0W3">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487161" data-verses="Galatians 1:6-7">1:6-7</span> Paul says, “I marvel that you are so quickly removing from Him who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel, which is not another gospel, only there are some who trouble you and desire to pervert the gospel of Christ.” Here Paul comes to his subject. Because the churches in Galatia were deserting the grace of Christ and backsliding to the observance of the law, Paul was burdened to write this Epistle. The “different gospel” mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487162" data-verses="Galatians 1:6">verse 6</span> denotes the Judaistic observance of the law. The grace of Christ is versus the law of Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487163" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>). The Judaizers troubled the churches by perverting the gospel of Christ, or distorting it, thus misleading the believers, taking them back to the law of Moses. However, the observance of the law could never be a gospel that sets free the <span id="5" data-page-id="5" class="pg">[5]</span> sinners under its bondage and brings them into the enjoyment of God. It could only keep them as slaves under its bondage.</p>

To be brought to nought is to be brought to nothing. In His salvation God has brought us into Christ and has made Christ to be profitable to us in every way. In His redemption God has placed us into His Son, who is now everything to us. But the Judaizers had caused the Galatian believers to be distracted from Christ to the law. By turning from Christ to the law, the Galatians were being brought to nothing from Christ. According to the King James Version, Paul said to the Galatians, “Christ is become of no effect unto you.” The Galatians were in a situation where the profitable Christ was of no effect to them. They were being deprived of all the profit that is in Christ and were separated from Him as a result. As the American Standard Version says, they were “severed from Christ.”</p>
    <h2 data-content-id="-yE40GSLZc0A9d_sxou3wz66PHqp3o8DPp15eAJmJ50FTvgHBVD3RIHxSPTV0JYsn" class="head3">2.

This implies that Christ Himself is the very grace and that we, the believers, are in Him as grace. The profitable Christ is grace to us. To be severed from Him is to be fallen from grace.</p>

Although they had been justified in Christ, they had gone back to keeping the law and were trying to be justified by the works of the law. What a devilish subtlety! Fallen man cannot be justified before God by keeping the law. The only way to be justified is by faith in Christ, by believing in the Lord Jesus. Nevertheless, the Galatian believers had been bewitched and therefore were trying to keep the law. They were endeavoring to be justified and to please God by their own works. <span id="6" data-page-id="6" class="pg">[6]</span> </p>

To Practice Circumcision</h2><p data-content-id="uVHhqDovtGpUzg484wqmJxKoP0VzZTizKkjxi_XOCcjBCdgLZBOGE9Ta3mCOB3zzZ">The Judaizers were also constraining the Galatians to practice circumcision (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487167" data-verses="Galatians 6:12">6:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487168" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">15</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487169" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span> God commanded Abraham and his male descendants to be circumcised. Any male who refused to be circumcised was to be cut off from God’s people. Circumcision, however, was simply a type of the crucifixion of Christ. The true circumcision that cuts off the flesh is not the circumcision practiced in the Old Testament; it is the crucifixion of Christ. Our flesh can be dealt with only by the cross of Christ. Christ’s crucifixion was the fulfillment of the type of circumcision. Since we have the reality of circumcision, there is no longer the need for the shadow. Nevertheless, the Judaizers turned the Galatian believers from the reality back to the shadow. How foolish!</p>

This means that the Galatians were trying to perfect themselves through their own effort, through the works of the flesh, in which there is nothing good. How foolish the Galatians were!</p>

    <p data-content-id="kDasksB5vFMzwQXxkHSTrHD9accrX40wQxIkGROXFEF4lQ_mMoAwUNq30jKQU6T_T">The subject of the book of Galatians is related to its background. The subject is Christ replacing the law and being versus religion and tradition. In his introduction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487171" data-verses="Galatians 1:1-5">vv. 1-5</span>), Paul expresses his burden to rescue the distracted believers out of the evil religious age. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487172" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span> Paul says that Christ “gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father.” An age is a part of the world as the satanic system. An age refers to a section, an aspect, the present or modern appearance, of the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. We may regard each decade as a distinct age or section of Satan’s world system. <span id="7" data-page-id="7" class="pg">[7]</span> </p>
    <p data-content-id="Jw-2Gf2mLlG_9SktQaieFf2WBHVPxLfqsZE2-EdZEFJ74DoreXntLhDSHOZINmBD-">The various ages of the satanic system are expressed in the fashions of clothing that prevail during a certain period of time. For example, in the 1950s men’s neckties were narrow, but in the late 1960s and throughout most of the 1970s, they were broad. Now, according to the latest change of style, they have become somewhat narrow again.</p>
    <p data-content-id="zAWRgSJEeshy3jNlKpCKh8CWk2hbU_aJNygwLNNTPO8qMW8SCbqNy_V6Uew8JqWP9">When I was young, I worked in a factory where hairnets were manufactured for export to the West. At first, the hairnets were large, designed to fit over hair styled in the shape of a tower. Then, to my surprise, we began to receive orders for small hairnets. The reason for the change was that women in the West were now wearing their hair very short, in a bobbed style, and therefore wanted small hairnets. By these illustrations of neckties and hairnets, we can see that the world system of Satan has different ages, different sections.</p>
    <p data-content-id="aeWQtqKFOYnBmO7EwnLKXrl7V9pEI17mnuL5wHRu7wY8AcOXol_FRANp_pzniJbTy"><em>The present evil age</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487173" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span>, according to the context of this book, refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion. This is confirmed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487174" data-verses="Galatians 6:14-15">6:14-15</span>, where circumcision is considered a part of the world—the religious world, which to the apostle Paul was crucified. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487175" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span> the apostle emphasized that the purpose of Christ’s giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us out, from the Jewish religion, the present evil age. This is to release God’s chosen people from the custody of the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487176" data-verses="Galatians 3:23">3:23</span>), to bring them out of the sheepfold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487177" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487178" data-verses="John 10:3">3</span>), according to the will of God. Thus, in his opening word, Paul indicated what he was going to deal with. He wanted to rescue the churches, which were distracted by Judaism with its law, and to bring them back to the grace of the gospel.</p>
    <p data-content-id="bPLRaSLqtjrhrwh4ZY_ZeoUyEApHitT8qsF4J5QwOg9QBF8HDIemOoElTjtCSpobD">For years I was fond of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487179" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">Galatians 1:4</span> and used this verse in messages. However, I did not realize that <em>the present evil age</em> in this verse refers to the Jewish religion. At the time of Paul, Judaism was very prevailing. His intention in writing to the Galatians was to rescue the distracted believers from the tyranny of the present evil religious age.</p>
    <p data-content-id="qPmcHvDy4nljKijbAKoXWCikA-xluNidIJTXU0MWMKaz_nCGWRqqdmsrV53jcTq3Z">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487180" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span> Paul points out that in order to rescue us from the present evil religious age, Christ gave Himself for our sins. This indicates that Christ died in order to rescue us from Judaism. <span id="8" data-page-id="8" class="pg">[8]</span> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487181" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> we see that Christ as the good Shepherd entered into the fold in order to bring His sheep out of the fold and into the pasture. The fold in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487182" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> signifies the law or Judaism as the religion of the law, in which God’s chosen people were kept and guarded in custody or ward until Christ came. Before the coming of Christ, God used Judaism as a fold to keep His sheep. But Christ has come as the Shepherd to bring the sheep out of that fold to the pasture where they may feed on His riches. Although Christ came to release the sheep from the fold, the Judaizers crucified this good Shepherd. He died on the cross not only for the sins of the sheep but also to bring them out of the fold.</p>
    <p data-content-id="yIJ51a1bFchL7SNS_c7ZbvAGicOEbRPJCx9Zl0XbkHULYdVL0SbvP-oxNuIaAe2Dc">According to the New Testament, the death of Christ on the cross accomplished many things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487183" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> we see that He gave Himself in order to abolish the ordinances for the creation of the one new man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487184" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">Galatians 1</span> we see that Christ gave Himself for our sins for the purpose of rescuing us out of religion, out of the present evil age.</p>
    <p data-content-id="8dBuSopZm16j3LCbMbeQ_ETFGlMT9HPHJscwLelykGcZ0AsUwhCBB7wAl5r98UMCJ">We should apply <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487185" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span> not only to the Galatian believers but also to today’s believers in Christ. Most Christians are held in some kind of religious fold. Although in the New Testament the term <em>fold</em> is not positive, certain Christian hymns speak of being brought back to the fold in some kind of positive sense. We have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487186" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> the fold denotes Judaism. In principle, Catholicism and all the denominations are folds. Only the church is God’s flock. Christ has brought us back to the flock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487187" data-verses="John 10:16">John 10:16</span>), not to the fold. Many of us can testify that we have been rescued out of the fold and brought back to God’s flock.</p>
    <p data-content-id="0QU6n_wvA5F6iUYDEKiLkyx_IonCDp2taO8EWrVIDRIXfePd4SxgWFsryaZa-CUC7">At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="487188" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span>, God’s people, His sheep, were in the fold of Judaism. But as this chapter makes clear, Christ came to bring His sheep out of the fold and to form them with the Gentile believers into one flock, the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="487189" data-verses="John 10:16">v. 16</span>). Hence, the fold is religion, whereas the flock is the church. Today Catholicism and the denominations are folds that keep Christ’s sheep. But Christ is seeking to rescue His sheep out of the various religious folds and to bring them together as the one flock.</p>
