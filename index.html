        <p>What does <b>"Zion in Zion"</b> mean?</p> 
        <p align="justify"><b>"Zion"</b> refers to what is mentioned in Psalm 132:13 and Isaiah 30:18. They read, "For Jehovah has chosen Zion; / He has desired it for His habitation" and "For a people will dwell in Zion..." Zion in the Bible signifies the dwelling place of God and His chosen people. Actually, Zion is the <b>mutual dwelling place</b> of God and man within each other. God becomes the dwelling place of His people and the people of God become the dwelling place of their God (<span class="ref"><a href="https://text.recoveryversion.bible/19_Psalms_90.htm#Psa90-1" target="_blank" class="withthose_pdf">Psalm 90:1</a></span><span class="ver"> "O Lord, <u>You</u> have been <u>our dwelling place</u> / In all generations."</span>; <span class="ref"><a href="https://text.recoveryversion.bible/23_Isaiah_66.htm#Isa66-1" target="_blank" class="withthose_pdf">Isaiah 66:1-2</a></span><span class="ver"> "Thus says Jehovah, / Heaven is My throne, / And the earth the footstool for My feet. / Where then is the <u>house</u> that you will build for Me, / And where is the place of My rest? For all these things My hand has made, / And [so] all these things have come into being, declares Jehovah. / But to this kind of <u>man</u> will I look, to [him who is] poor / And of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word."</span>; <span class="ref"><a href="https://text.recoveryversion.bible/43_John_14.htm#Joh14-20" target="_blank" class="withthose_pdf">John 14:20</a></span><span class="ver"> "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and <u>you in Me, and I in you</u>."</span>). Hence, the phrase, "Zion in Zion" describes the wonderful promise according to the Bible, the precious reality I am living today as a foretaste, and the glorious future God and man will enjoy in full for eternity.</p>
