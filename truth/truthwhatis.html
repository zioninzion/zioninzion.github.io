      <div class="title">Truth, what is?</div>
      <p>We come to the last part of the three-part series to answer the question, “What is truth?” Now that we know that Truth is a person, we must interact with Him. Our search for truth must take place transactionally and relationally with this person. Hence, the first word of the title of this post—Truth, what is?—addresses the person—Truth Himself. And the question we need to ask Him is, “What is?”</p>
      <p>The question is intended for Truth to direct us to that which is, that is, that which has being, substance, reality, and veer us away from that which is not, that which is false and illusory. Thusly we will come to know truth in a fuller way.</p>
      <p>In all of reality, something must have being of itself. Yes, the screen through which you are viewing this post has being—but not of itself. It does not exist by virtue of itself. Rather, it exists as the result of being made by someone (that’s not itself) and through a process (that precedes itself).1 As we trace back this line of origin, we come to the very beginning of time itself.2 What is the cause of time itself? This question is not asking, “What came before time?”—since that would be oxymoronic. Before is temporal language, inherently tied to the concept of time. The origin of time itself cannot accurately be described as being before time; rather, it is beyond time. Such an origin must, by definition, be a timeless, spaceless, and immaterial entity possessing agency.3</p>
      <p>The ultimate answer to the question—What is Truth?—must be “I am.” All things are contingent and incidental—except for one. There must be a singular entity with agency that transcends time and space, one that is self-sufficient and the source of all existence. Ultimately, anyone who genuinely seeks truth will arrive at the realization that there is someone who simply is. He, in Himself and by Himself, is. He, apart from anything else—not being dependent on anything or anyone else—just is. This concept is challenging to grasp due to the spatiotemporal tendencies of the human mind, yet it remains the inevitable conclusion of logic taken to its final end.</p>
      <p>This entity is not a nebulous force or a “universal energy,” some undefinable cosmic entity. Rather, this is God in its classical meaning. He is a person and He has revealed Himself in the most wonderful way in the man Jesus. He is the I Am.4</p>
      <p>Having being is more involved than just having an origin. It also entails a constant maintenance of being to remain “being.” However, this latter concept is harder to grasp and will be addressed more thoroughly in a later post.</p>
      <p>And of the entire observable universe.</p>
      <p>The fact that there is being instead no being (apart from the being that necessarily exists of itself) implies that there was an act of will. And will indicates an agency.</p>
