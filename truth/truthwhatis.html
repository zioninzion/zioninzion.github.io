      <div class="title">Truth, what is?</div>
      <p>We come to the last part of the three-part series to answer the question, “What is truth?” Now that we know that Truth is a person, we must interact with Him. Our search for truth must take place transactionally and relationally with this person. Hence, the first word of the title of this post—Truth, what is?—addresses the person—Truth Himself. And the question we need to ask Him is, “What is?”</p>
      <p>The question is intended for Truth to direct us to that which <em>is</em>, that is, that which has being, substance, reality, and to steer us away from that which is <em>not</em>—that which is false and illusory. Thusly we will come to know truth in a fuller way.</p>
      <p>In all of reality, something must have being of itself. Yes, the screen, through which you are viewing this post, has being—but not of itself. It does not exist by virtue of itself. Rather, it exists as the result of being made by someone (that’s not itself) and through a process (that precedes itself).<sup data-fn="b98bd17a-c344-4162-8517-4fe022de839e" class="fn"><a href="#b98bd17a-c344-4162-8517-4fe022de839e" id="b98bd17a-c344-4162-8517-4fe022de839e-link">1</a></sup> As we trace back this line of origin, we come to the very beginning of time itself.<sup data-fn="c9f1d2b4-0613-41ae-ab08-a0b2fb7ec5cf" class="fn"><a href="#c9f1d2b4-0613-41ae-ab08-a0b2fb7ec5cf" id="c9f1d2b4-0613-41ae-ab08-a0b2fb7ec5cf-link">2</a></sup> What is the cause of time itself? This question is not asking, “What came&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;time?”—since that would be oxymoronic.&nbsp;<em>Before</em>&nbsp;is temporal language, inherently tied to the concept of time. The origin of time itself cannot accurately be described as being&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;time; rather, it is <em>beyond</em> time. Such an origin must, by definition, be a timeless, spaceless, and immaterial entity possessing agency.<sup data-fn="8decd652-c7dc-4bfd-9c5b-3f5e0562bb41" class="fn"><a href="#8decd652-c7dc-4bfd-9c5b-3f5e0562bb41" id="8decd652-c7dc-4bfd-9c5b-3f5e0562bb41-link">3</a></sup></p>
      <p>The ultimate answer to the question—<em>What is Truth?</em>—must be “<strong>I am</strong>.” All things are contingent and incidental—except for one. There must be a singular entity with agency that transcends time and space, one that is self-sufficient and the source of all existence. Ultimately, everyone who genuinely seeks truth needs to arrive at the realization that there is someone who simply&nbsp;<em>is</em>. He, in Himself and by Himself, <strong><em>is</em></strong>. He, apart from anything else—not being dependent on anything or anyone else—just <strong><em>is</em></strong>. This concept is challenging to grasp due to the spatiotemporal tendencies of the human mind, yet it remains the inevitable conclusion of logic taken to its final end.</p>
      <p>This entity is not a nebulous force or a “universal energy,” some undefinable cosmic entity. Rather, this is <em>God</em> in its classical meaning. He is a person and He has revealed Himself in the most wonderful way in the man Jesus. He is the <em>I Am</em>.<sup data-fn="ee930c2b-24f1-43de-974c-773e63f3b1f4" class="fn"><a href="#ee930c2b-24f1-43de-974c-773e63f3b1f4" id="ee930c2b-24f1-43de-974c-773e63f3b1f4-link">4</a></sup> Hence, to know truth is to know this one, this God—who is true and who is the truth—not only mentally ad objectively, but, as mentioned before,  transactionally and relationally—<strong>personally</strong>—according to what He is and what He wants to be to us.<sup data-fn="3f1eb356-473b-4b95-8f03-afc378ce067d" class="fn"><a href="#3f1eb356-473b-4b95-8f03-afc378ce067d" id="3f1eb356-473b-4b95-8f03-afc378ce067d-link">5</a></sup></p>
      <p>It is with this in mind that I invite you to come explore with me the truth concerning this truth.</p>
      <ol class="wp-block-footnotes"><li id="b98bd17a-c344-4162-8517-4fe022de839e">Having <em>being</em> is more involved than just having an origin. It also entails a constant maintenance of being to remain “being.” However, this latter concept is harder to grasp and will be addressed more thoroughly in a later post. <a href="#b98bd17a-c344-4162-8517-4fe022de839e-link">↩︎</a></li><li id="c9f1d2b4-0613-41ae-ab08-a0b2fb7ec5cf">And of the entire observable universe. <a href="#c9f1d2b4-0613-41ae-ab08-a0b2fb7ec5cf-link">↩︎</a></li><li id="8decd652-c7dc-4bfd-9c5b-3f5e0562bb41">The fact that there is being instead of no being (apart from the being that necessarily exists of itself) implies that there was an act of will that brought about being.
